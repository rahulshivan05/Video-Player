00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,640
Train No 0377 going from
Allahabad to Gomtinagar...

3
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,860
...the Vivah Special Express,
will soon leave from Platform No. 3.

4
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,640
This is a special train.
It is overbooked.

5
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,560
They say, matches are made in heaven,

6
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,500
but the timing is decided here,
on earth.

7
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,430
In the city of Allahabad alone, 13,000
weddings will take place... today.

8
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,650
One would think that the
entire Indian economy runs on

9
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,770
the business of conducting weddings.

10
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,900
And we, the loyal citizens,
are running,

11
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,290
to make our contributions
toward the economy.

12
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,910
I am Kartik Singh, and I'm running...

13
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,780
And I am Aman Tripathi,
and I'm running as well.

14
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,420
I was six,
the first time I had to run.

15
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,900
The local boys hated my hair colour.

16
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,050
The only thought I had,
every time I ran was...

17
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,520
One day, I could be like
the superstar Amitabh Bachchan.

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,510
'I have never followed anyone...
always taken the lead.'

19
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,910
Two whacks from my father,
taught me two things.

20
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,910
One: Running doesn't
help you grow up any faster.

21
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,600
Two: You can't just
become a superstar...

22
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,950
You have to be born as one.

23
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,100
In my case, I was running
away from love, not violence.

24
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,160
As my family was running after me,
to put cake on my face.

25
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,380
Mummy always said that I am different.

26
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,610
But all their love, coupled
with all that frosting on my face...

27
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,850
made me look no different from them.

28
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,830
I've been running ever since.

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,590
But today, it's a different story.

30
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,820
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

31
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,250
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

32
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,290
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

33
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,290
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

34
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,570
Hey Kartik, nobody here is
interested in celebrating their love.

35
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,220
So what, if they are not listening?

36
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,470
We will make ourselves heard.

37
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,000
How do we do that?

38
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,980
Go and sit on that kiddie train.

39
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,340
Crazy or what?

40
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,140
Go on, I have to fight these germs.

41
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,010
Are you on a holiday or what?

42
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,330
Get up!

43
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,130
Get up!

44
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,040
Hello?

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,000
Mummy?

46
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,640
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

47
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,900
Don't know about my toothpaste.

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,050
But I do have a heart that
beats for my darling Guddu.

49
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,380
Wait a minute.

50
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,390
Hold on, Guddu.

51
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,530
Down with black cauliflowers!

52
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,710
These farmers protesting against the
black cauliflowers are driving us mad.

53
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,020
So, when are you coming home?

54
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,610
Goggle is getting married.

55
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,460
We'll leave early morning tomorrow.

56
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,500
Our train leaves at 06:55.
Get some more of these.

57
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,250
Mummy, I won't be going home.
I had told you.

58
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,120
How many times must I repeat myself?

59
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,130
You idiot!

60
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,850
Is this why I gave
you those polio drops?

61
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,320
So you could keep running
away from me, huh?

62
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,210
I'm very busy, Mummy.

63
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,430
I keep telling you this.

64
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,170
I don't need your money.

65
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,250
What does 10,000 amount to, anyway?

66
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,240
Fine, don't come.

67
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,810
There's a wedding taking place,

68
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,920
the entire family is coming together.

69
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
And you can't make it!

70
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,420
So what?

71
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,610
They are around anyway.

72
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,340
Step out of the door
and they're all there.

73
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,440
Die! You bloody dog!

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,730
May you lose your job!

75
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,080
I hope you break your hand!

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,240
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

77
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,250
All you can think of is whether
your toothpaste can love you.

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,480
What about all the love
you've got from the family?

79
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,780
Hang up now.

80
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,850
Now that you've called
and I'm getting billed for it,

81
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,010
go on, carry on with your ranting.

82
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,150
We were never outgoing anyway,

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,450
we'll become incoming again.

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,750
Bye!

85
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,300
Does your toothpaste celebrate love?

86
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,690
Aunty, should I keep a
mosquito coil in Guddu's room?

87
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,890
Or is he still allergic to it?

88
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:00,890
Guddu is dead!

89
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,550
He got run over...
cut into two pieces.

90
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,940
The top half was claimed by his work.

91
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,940
And the bottom half...

92
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,490
Is this because of a girl?

93
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,340
Kusum!

94
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,030
The black cauliflower created by

95
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,110
agricultural scientist,
Shri Shankar Tripathi

96
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,720
has created unrest among
the farmers in UP.

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,690
Oh God!

98
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,630
Where is Guddu's father?

99
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,040
Mummy!

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
Aren't we supposed to
complete these rituals on time?

101
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,940
I've been ready and
waiting for so long...

102
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,200
and no one is bothered.

103
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,530
Everyone's busy catching
stupid cauliflowers.

104
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,160
Wait, my turn.
Move. Move away.

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,570
May God help you.

106
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,450
You can't even handle a cauliflower,

107
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,860
how will you handle your wife?

108
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,360
I'll be able to handle everything,
just get married, Uncle.

109
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,210
How will he get you married?

110
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,540
Uncle, move, a black cauliflower!

111
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,830
He hasn't been able to get his
daughter married in all these years!

112
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,640
She is getting married tomorrow.

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,590
I couldn't find a suitable boy.

114
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,290
It did take some time,
but I've finally found somebody.

115
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,180
You haven't.

116
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,550
It's your brother who
has found... that ancient relic.

117
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,410
Any longer, and he would
have become a museum exhibit.

118
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,600
Mummy!

119
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,070
Don't you dare badmouth Ashok.

120
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll set the house on fire,
let me tell you.

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,630
Where is he?

122
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,630
Should we start the rituals?

123
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,410
Has anyone seen Guddu's father?

124
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,290
Oh God, these damn cauliflowers.

125
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,200
Chaman!

126
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,590
Yes, what happened?

127
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,330
Have you seen Guddu's father?

128
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,460
He's there, on the terrace.

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,200
This damn terrace
is like his mistress...

130
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,760
he's always on top of it.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,580
Let's go.

132
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,640
Down with the black cauliflower!

133
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
The cauliflower has ruined us all.

134
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,870
Shankar Tripathi, shame on you!

135
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,870
The cauliflower has ruined us all.

136
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,970
Shankar Tripathi, shame on you!

137
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,230
Shankar Tripathi, shame on you!

138
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,180
There is always hope...
Have you seen this, Uncle?

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,840
A miracle.

140
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,340
Let me gift you a sack
of these black cauliflowers.

141
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,270
No, no thank you, Shankar.

142
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,100
Take it. It's good for the children,
very nutritious.

143
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,870
This is what we've been
eating for the past week.

144
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,680
- Really?
- Yes!

145
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,320
Did you hear that, Gauri Shankar?

146
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,460
He's been eating this since
the past week, and he's still alive.

147
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,330
He's fine.

148
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,620
Tell me something, these
farmers who say they've been ruined...

149
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,230
were they any better off, earlier?

150
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,870
Er...

151
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,660
No way!

152
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,920
Their cauliflowers get infested with
worms,

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
- See this, Uncle.
- our black cauliflowers don't.

154
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,340
What's this?

155
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,850
Our neighbourhood.

156
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,260
Wow!

157
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,210
Gauri Shankar, our neighbourhood
is featured on the internet.

158
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,420
This is...
our house. And isn't this...

159
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,940
Mr. Mishra's terrace?

160
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,410
Correct, those are his wife's
undergarments put up for drying. See.

161
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,040
It's theirs.

162
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,060
Whatever.

163
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,680
It's great that our neighbourhood
is featured on the internet.

164
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,400
I'll celebrate by giving all of
you a sack of black cauliflowers each.

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
Where are you?

166
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,070
I'm right here. What happened?

167
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,390
See this, Uncle.

168
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,420
Why are you creating a ruckus?
I'm right here.

169
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,650
Kusum.

170
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,490
She's Mr. Nagar's daughter, isn't it?

171
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,240
I've spoken to her mother
and booked her for the past one year.

172
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,050
Booked her for what?

173
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,190
For our Guddu.

174
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,470
Right.

175
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,470
What do you mean right?

176
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,960
I've been stalling for a year now.

177
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,360
Gifting dry fruits won't work anymore.

178
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,470
I'd thought of getting Guddu married to
her when he'd visit for Goggle's wedding.

179
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,700
But your darling son
has refused to come home.

180
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,230
Where are you running off to?

181
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,410
I'm feeling shy, Aunty.

182
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,960
Let's finalise things first.

183
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,480
Okay, you can go.

184
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,650
Take this... bangle.

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,810
It's a gift from me
and a promise from his side.

186
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,860
But...

187
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,490
God bless you...

188
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,790
You better practice calling me Mummy,
from now.

189
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,510
Go on.

190
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,710
Don't misplace it.

191
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,070
I have just the one - bangle and son.

192
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,000
Why don't you say something?

193
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,480
What can I say, madam Sunaina?

194
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,930
You're the one speaking on my behalf.

195
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,340
Don't worry, I'll speak to Guddu.

196
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,420
He'll come home.

197
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,590
Brother!

198
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,900
Hurry up! The police are
about beat up the protestors.

199
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,840
No... it's okay.

200
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,210
Will someone start with the rituals?

201
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,890
Mummy, I guess we're done.

202
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm ready to get married now.

203
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,070
Keshav, start the music.

204
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,040
Our lives have come together as one
Just like the river meets the sea

205
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,780
I want our lives
to flow together forever

206
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,190
Knowing you I have realised

207
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,870
That life can be so beautiful

208
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,510
I always want to be with you

209
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,790
Whether we win over this world or not

210
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,480
Happiness will drive away our sorrows

211
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,160
When you are with me
Nothing else matters

212
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,710
You are all that I need

213
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,150
You are all that I need
- This is Devika's house.

214
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,430
We'll help her elope.

215
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,060
Stop... stop.

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,010
Help me with the stand first.

217
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,340
Go in, what are you waiting for?

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,690
I will.

219
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,160
Keep the engine running.

220
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,960
I can't start this piece of junk.

221
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,490
Start it for me.

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,400
I've told you so many
times to get it repaired.

223
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,810
It will cost you 100 bucks.
But you're so stingy.

224
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,570
You scared?

225
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,970
Shit scared.

226
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,140
Come here.

227
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,000
We'll handle everything.

228
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,520
Devika!

229
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,620
Devika!

230
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,830
Devika!

231
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,590
You dog!

232
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,250
I've been waiting for so long.

233
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,180
It's my first time...
getting a girl to elope.

234
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,210
Really?

235
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,930
As if I elope every single day.

236
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,240
What if we get caught?

237
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,570
Let me jump first.

238
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll keep an eye on your father.

239
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Okay.

240
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,390
If he comes out,
I'll make a run for it.

241
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,170
What about me?

242
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,880
I'll keep hanging from the balcony?

243
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,110
Tell him that you were
drying clothes and you fell.

244
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,520
You dumbass, my father
watches quiz shows all the time.

245
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,470
He's not stupid.

246
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,070
By the way, we have a dryer at home.

247
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,340
We don't put clothes
out to dry on the balcony.

248
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
'That's the right answer.'

249
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,540
If your father had brains, he would've
put a grill around the balcony.

250
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,290
What do you mean?

251
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,430
Girls who have open balconies
are the first ones to have affairs.

252
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,100
All the Delhi boys know this.

253
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,450
Girls living on first
floors are easy targets.

254
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,950
Have you come to help me elope

255
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,990
or to explain first floor-second floor
dynamics, in this ridiculous costume?

256
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,990
Kartik!

257
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,960
What's taking you so long?

258
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,980
This piece of junk has stopped again.

259
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,960
What?

260
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,540
Oh God!

261
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,830
Listen, the commercial
break will get over in a minute.

262
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,820
Dad won't budge from
his seat after that.

263
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,120
Next up is the
million-dollar question...

264
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,020
Followed by a three-minute
lecture by the host.

265
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,630
Yes, that much he deserves.

266
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,590
Then again,
there will be a commercial break.

267
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,710
You have five minutes
to get me out of here.

268
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,620
Okay?

269
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,190
Will your boyfriend, Ravi turn up?

270
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,170
There is no guarantee
for first loves.

271
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,510
Ravi isn't my first love,
and you know that.

272
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,560
He has sent me the location pin and...

273
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,350
100,000 bucks in cash.

274
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,400
OMFG!

275
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,560
So much cash!

276
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,920
It's from the Education Policy
that Dad had bought for me.

277
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,430
Kartik!

278
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,070
Policies mature way
before daughters do, here.

279
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,570
Hurry up.

280
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,270
Please take care of this,
Amitabh Bachchan.

281
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,330
Kartik! Hurry up, guys!

282
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,780
- 'One million!'
- Who is there?

283
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,980
Let's go, Aman!

284
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,310
- Start the bike!
- I can't!

285
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,880
- Kartik!
- Oh hell!

286
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,090
You guys can't get anything right!

287
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,890
Dad will kill me!
Start the bike!

288
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,010
Aman, come here!

289
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,570
Get him off me!

290
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,280
Grab him from the back.

291
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,190
Not me, grab him!

292
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,660
Grab him from the back.

293
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,140
Run, Aman!

294
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,940
Stop!

295
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,300
Where are you going?

296
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,180
Stop!

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,140
Why isn't he answering?

298
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,690
Aman, why weren't
you picking up the call?

299
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,690
'Coz he's busy picking up girls.

300
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,070
What're you saying, Uncle?
Give the phone to me.

301
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,920
Hello? Who is this? Hello?

302
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,030
You goon, how dare you touch him!

303
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,290
It's my father...

304
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,590
Don't you dare do anything to him.

305
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,650
Give my phone back.

306
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,380
Have you spoken to Guddu?

307
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,700
You were right.

308
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,480
This whole thing is about a girl.

309
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,550
I knew it.

310
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,380
He's a young man.
I'd asked you to keep an eye on him.

311
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,610
But you were so busy
with your black cauliflowers.

312
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,250
We've lost control of our son.

313
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,520
Guess I've lost my
gold bangle as well.

314
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,540
It's all because
of the farmers' curse.

315
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,050
Can you be quiet?

316
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,240
Let me think.

317
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,740
Your naïve son has got
entangled with a Delhi girl.

318
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,500
Do something about it.

319
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,400
What do I do?

320
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,810
Reel him in.

321
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,500
Catch those pests!

322
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,860
What the hell are you doing?

323
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,390
Those bloody losers ran away.

324
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,640
They got scared.

325
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,440
This is our area!

326
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,630
All I had to do was make a call.

327
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,320
Listen, let's go to your place.

328
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,130
We live together, remember?

329
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,880
I meant, your house in Allahabad.

330
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,040
Isn't your cousin getting married?

331
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,100
We won't go there.

332
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,310
I have the best plan.

333
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,080
We'll have a blast there.

334
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,840
What's wrong with you?

335
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,060
I'm not taking you there.

336
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,680
Why?

337
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,490
I'm worth it and you know it.

338
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,260
Nobody knows about
us back home, Kartik.

339
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,230
As if we'll tell them.

340
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,380
No wonder you're so scared.

341
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,200
We could go tell your father,
'Uncle, get us married as well.'

342
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,450
Very funny, huh?

343
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,920
We were helping Devika run away,
remember?

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Now we're running away, ourselves.

345
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,470
I know, I've been
beaten black and blue.

346
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,730
All over.

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,550
But I don't care.

348
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,100
Anything for love.

349
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,850
It is the result
of someone else's love.

350
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,190
Love is love, after all.

351
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,260
Remember, we're the good germs.
They're the bad ones.

352
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,800
- We're the bad ones.
- Good germs.

353
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,730
- Bad.
- Good.

354
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,950
- I'm not going to Allahabad.
- Good.

355
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,210
- Kartik, try to understand.
- Good.

356
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,390
- My family won't...
- We are good germs!

357
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,900
Stop shouting, they'll...

358
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,100
Where do we go now?

359
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,170
You loser, come here!
I'll teach you a lesson!

360
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,920
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,590
Rickshaw!

362
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,390
- Stop, stop!
- Come on!

363
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,350
Hurry up!
Get in!

364
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,350
Take us to Nizamuddin railway station.

365
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,970
Passengers, please pay attention.

366
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:13,280
Train No 0377 going from
Allahabad to Gomtinagar...

367
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,910
...the Vivah Special Express,
will soon leave from Platform No. 3.

368
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,700
Do you know the superhero Shaktiman?

369
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,510
Where are we?

370
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,230
Allahabad.

371
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,840
We've reached your hometown.
Get up.

372
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,000
What time does the train leave?

373
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,050
6:55 am.

374
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,140
Hurry up then.

375
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,220
Listen, if you meet Shaktiman,
tell him...

376
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,250
I know that Gangadhar
is the real Shaktiman.

377
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,000
Passengers, please pay attention...

378
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,640
...has arrived.

379
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,840
...has arrived.

380
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,870
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

381
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,570
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

382
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,230
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

383
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,060
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

384
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,170
When the DJ plays a romantic song

385
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,900
My Baby follows me everywhere

386
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,270
She asks me to dance with her

387
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,990
And pulls me to the dance floor

388
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,380
When you come to me and I come to you...

389
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,200
Everybody sings Oo la a...
la la... ooo

390
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,190
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

391
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,800
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

392
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,510
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

393
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,590
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

394
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,120
Oo la a... la la... ooo...

395
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,770
Oh Sheila,
my shirt seems to be coming off

396
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,920
I am ready for some fun
I wonder why

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,730
Where have you come from?
You've set my heart on fire

398
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,150
Your moves drive me crazy

399
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,790
When I say, I love you
And you say, love you too

400
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,450
Everybody sings oo la la...
la la... ooo

401
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,040
Oo la la... la la... ooo...

402
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,810
Oo la la... la la... ooo...

403
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,660
Oo la la... la la... ooo...

404
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,160
What are you doing?

405
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,430
Are you crazy?

406
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,990
It's been so long.

407
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,570
I need your touch.

408
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,200
Everybody sings oo la la...
la la... ooo

409
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,180
Oo la la... la la... ooo...

410
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,850
He's an educated man.

411
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm sure he knows.

412
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,540
No, seeing us glued together,
he'd think it's an ad for a glue!

413
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,440
He shouldn't come. I told him.

414
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,600
You're correct!

415
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,530
If nothing else works,
a glue will surely bring you together.

416
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,490
Let's put up a big sign at
the ITO crossing, of us kissing.

417
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,860
Kartik!

418
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,360
Dad has passed out and you're
still in the mood to fool around?

419
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,970
Why didn't you notice him there?

420
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,090
You didn't, either.

421
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,180
He's your father!

422
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,310
Stop shouting.

423
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,820
Will be delayed for sometime...

424
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,440
You know I am passionate
about everything, right?

425
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,000
I close my eyes every time I kiss you.

426
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,110
I don't care about anything around me.

427
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,470
I didn't see your father.

428
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,230
I close my eyes as
well when I kiss you.

429
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,990
I have passion in me as well.

430
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,900
When we get physical,
you complain that I'm distracted.

431
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,120
That I'm lost.

432
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,890
Today, I was completely focused.

433
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,030
Aww,

434
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,240
you're my strong baby.

435
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,150
My baby strongest!

436
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,220
You're wrong,
the phrase is, 'My Daddy Strongest'.

437
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,370
And this...

438
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,240
Kusum is looking at us.

439
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,970
I'm sure he has told them.

440
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,480
Everyone must be talking about it now.

441
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,560
Open your mouth.

442
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,330
Show me your teeth.

443
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,200
Why?

444
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,430
Because our teeth are
our strongest weapons.

445
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,160
Weapons of mass destruction.

446
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,090
Are we dogs?

447
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,300
We will be, if required.

448
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,700
A mother's motherly love...

449
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,740
A father's fatherly love...
An uncle's uncle-ly love.

450
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,580
And an aunt's...

451
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,780
What kind of love would she have?

452
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,300
I'm sure it's motherly
love as well, Kartik.

453
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,490
Whatever.

454
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,740
If they can use that as a weapon,

455
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,080
why can't we,
use our teeth as weapons?

456
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,020
You will be a dog. We will be dogs.

457
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,850
The first time my father
caught me with a boy...

458
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,170
...he beat the crap
out of me and... I bit him.

459
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,510
- Yeah, I became...
- A dog?

460
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,220
Yes.

461
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,600
I can't be one, Kartik.

462
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,080
He's my father.

463
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,850
What did he eat this morning?

464
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,910
Black cauliflower.

465
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,460
And last night?

466
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,500
Black cauliflower.

467
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,460
What else would he eat?

468
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
He's a scientist.
It's his new creation.

469
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,790
The farmers have thrown tons
of this cauliflower at our doorstep.

470
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,050
It will feed four generations.

471
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,190
What's so funny?

472
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,120
I was just...

473
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,550
Wait, I've been slaving
in the kitchen all my life.

474
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,040
This has never happened.

475
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,610
It's the first time a random doctor
is questioning my cooking skills.

476
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,420
But...

477
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,180
Why don't you say something?

478
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,450
From now on,
all of you will cook your own food.

479
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,640
Come on Bhabhi, no one's blaming you.

480
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,430
Doctor, all the women
work together in the kitchen.

481
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,110
So, they are all to blame.

482
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,840
It's not our fault, Doctor.

483
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,990
It's the black cauliflower.

484
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,220
That's all we've been
eating for the last two weeks.

485
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,850
It's your daughter
who's getting married.

486
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,780
You don't need to act so coy, Champa.

487
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,400
I didn't say anything wrong.

488
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,610
I've ended up sleeping with black
cauliflowers, instead of Chaman.

489
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,720
This is how bad it is.

490
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,740
Look, this is your personal matter...

491
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,780
Wait a minute.

492
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,020
If you're so troubled,
find yourselves another house.

493
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,070
I've spent all my
life looking after you.

494
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,250
You? You've looked after us?

495
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,020
I wake up at 4 a.m. everyday!

496
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,080
I've been fetching buckets of water and
filling the water tank for 35 years now.

497
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,060
Cooking doesn't count for everything.

498
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,280
We'll fit a pipe to
the tank after you leave.

499
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,740
You need not worry about that.

500
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,580
So, that's how insignificant we are!

501
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,150
If he'd allowed to
Chaman to study law...

502
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,490
...we'd have had more
standing in this family.

503
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,590
Remember, it was Chaman
who couldn't clear the law exam.

504
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,130
We didn't stop anyone from studying.

505
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,420
And why did he fail the exam?

506
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,860
Why?

507
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,200
Questions were out of syllabus...

508
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,610
If their mother had given
Chaman almonds, as well...

509
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,930
...then he would have
definitely cleared the exam.

510
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,880
Why do all arguments
revolve around my law degree?

511
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,180
Champa's dream of being the queen of
the house has made her a drama queen.

512
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,770
We should have seen this coming...

513
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,400
...when we'd seen her family members
secretly eating omelettes, at her wedding.

514
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,070
Do you know Doctor, while
they claim they're pure vegetarians,

515
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,440
They're actually...

516
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,940
Why bring this up again?

517
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,650
Aunty...

518
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,730
It was an eggless omelette!

519
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,900
I've been hearing
this for 35 years now.

520
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,360
Everybody's out to spoil my big day.

521
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,140
They're jealous.

522
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,510
Goggle...

523
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,700
Move.

524
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,130
Bhabhi, you're the older one,
she's younger to you.

525
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,300
- Please...
- Shut up.

526
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,240
She has you dancing to her tunes.

527
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,530
You're totally henpecked.

528
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,580
Homeopathic or allopathic?

529
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,060
- Homeopathic.
- Allopathic.

530
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,460
Fine, I'll prescribe
some allopathic medicines.

531
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,370
Everyone is entitled
to his or her beliefs.

532
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,630
Get these medicines from the store.

533
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,660
Right now?

534
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,610
Of course.

535
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,120
Don't worry.

536
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,000
The train stops for
about 20 minutes here.

537
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,490
There is a protest up ahead.

538
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,710
Till then you can eat
your 'eggless' omelettes.

539
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,850
Get these, quickly.

540
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,240
- He is awake.
- Brother?

541
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,660
Don't worry, it's not a protest
against the black cauliflowers.

542
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,230
Many an ill befall us, Mr. Tripathi.

543
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,040
Now that you're up,
why don't you take a short walk?

544
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,860
Okay?

545
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,100
I'll take your leave now.

546
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,380
Let's go.

547
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,220
Move, Kusum.

548
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,760
This way, Doctor.

549
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,550
Why is he so quiet, Doctor?

550
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,480
I can only prescribe medicines for
what ails his body not what ails his mind.

551
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,230
Nice.

552
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,730
You write poetry as well?

553
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,660
No.

554
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,940
People pay to hear my diagnosis.

555
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,560
Who would pay, to hear poetry?

556
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
But it was good.

557
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,590
Snacks! Snacks!

558
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,570
Oh, he's here.

559
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,280
- Go. Go and speak to him.
- I won't.

560
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,820
Come on.

561
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,420
Go and tell him that you love
me and nothing can keep us apart.

562
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,070
How do I go and talk to him?

563
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,660
He looks like he'll throw up,
every time he sees me.

564
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,870
I won't go. I'm scared.

565
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,090
This is the time. Be an angry
young man, like Vijay in Deewar.

566
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,870
Be a man. Be like Vijay,
the one who stays undefeated.

567
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,900
Really?

568
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,260
He looked quite defeated to me,
in Deewar...

569
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,760
..when Ravi threw the
'Mother' punch line at him.

570
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,070
What the hell!

571
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,150
The parents of the world seem to have
the best punch lines in all arguments.

572
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,600
Let's go together.

573
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,110
If Vijay and Ravi approach
them together, things will get sorted.

574
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,830
Yeah, right.

575
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,720
And I'll be the one
getting beaten up twice.

576
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,490
First by my own father
and then by yours.

577
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,770
I'm not going with you, you coward!

578
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,020
I'm going back to Delhi.

579
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,270
Hello, train? Train! Hello!

580
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,950
Okay fine. I'm going, Kartik.

581
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,290
Listen,

582
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,340
my father is an uneducated blacksmith.

583
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,040
He doesn't get all this.

584
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,590
But your father is
an educated man... he will.

585
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,630
Try and be a hero, bro.

586
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,460
Hell, why did I call you bro?

587
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,120
What do I say?

588
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,850
The truth.

589
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,780
Why do I fall for this emotional...

590
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,880
I love Kartik, Papa.

591
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,880
We can't live without each other.

592
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,040
I love Kartik, Papa.

593
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,990
We can't live without each other.

594
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,080
I love you, Papa. I mean Kartik.

595
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,320
I love you too, Papa.

596
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,270
I love Kartik, Papa.

597
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,990
- Come on, get on top and fix it.
- Wait!

598
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,350
Everyone will get water.

599
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,160
This is not right.

600
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,880
What, sir?

601
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,950
This is not the right way.

602
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,680
Hold the pipe like this.

603
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,810
Papa?

604
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,950
Papa?

605
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:48,890
Turn it on.

606
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,190
Yes.

607
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,500
What did I tell you?

608
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,890
There's a science to this.

609
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,010
Papa?

610
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,180
Papa?

611
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,440
What are you doing?

612
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,430
It hurts!

613
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,190
Papa!

614
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,640
It's very hot...

615
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,390
prickly heat, you know.

616
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,530
This is the best way to beat the heat.

617
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,310
It's okay.

618
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,640
You can always change.

619
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,790
Chaman's clothes will fit you.

620
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,740
Listen, stay away from that boy.

621
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,750
This is not right.

622
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,990
Your sister is getting married,
come on.

623
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,270
Get up.

624
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,530
Get up.

625
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,190
What's wrong?

626
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,320
Papa is looking at us.

627
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,900
What are you doing here?

628
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,890
What did I do?

629
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,250
I didn't do anything.

630
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,320
What can I do?

631
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,850
Shankar Tripathi,
son of Deenanath Tripathi, is useless.

632
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,100
A father, who can't control his son,
is useless.

633
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,700
Did you speak to Guddu?

634
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,120
Did he tell you about the girl?

635
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,660
This boy, I tell you,
will embarrass us with this girl.

636
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,860
That embarrassment
would be nothing, but he...

637
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,510
What kind of embarrassment?
What are you talking about?

638
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,780
Aunty!

639
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,770
What?

640
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,330
Sorry, Mummy.

641
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,130
So, which one do you like?
This one? Or that one?

642
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,430
The yellow one.

643
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,490
What about him?

644
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,230
Who?

645
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,230
- Him.
- Who 'him'?

646
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,380
Aman.

647
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,840
She's right here!

648
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,990
She's here! Kusum is here!

649
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,380
Someone's calling you.

650
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,030
Yes, I heard.

651
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,880
You should go immediately
when someone calls you.

652
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,170
Else, it's bad luck.

653
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,580
Now that you'll be
our daughter-in-law...

654
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,540
Sunaina...
I hope this girl is patient.

655
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,720
Else, all our hopes will get dashed.

656
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,670
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

657
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,140
Are you feeling okay?

658
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,750
Sunaina...

659
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,160
I'm very upset today.

660
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,120
Okay, I'll give in this one time.

661
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,190
It's not often that you're so upset.

662
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,230
It took me a long
time to wear this sari.

663
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,230
You'll have to help me wear it again.

664
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
Let's go.

665
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,350
Goggle! What is this, my dear?

666
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,400
You asked for a band, I arranged it.

667
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,980
You asked for a wedding procession,
I arranged it.

668
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,590
Now what's this tantrum
about going on a horse?

669
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,580
Don't label my desires
as tantrums, Papa!

670
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,150
It might be Ashok's second one, but
it's the first time I'm getting married.

671
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,140
If he doesn't want to come on a horse,
fine. I will.

672
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,130
What will his family think?

673
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,510
Why bother worrying about it?

674
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,210
Let's go and find out.

675
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,760
Go. Fly on an aeroplane
for all I care!

676
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,450
Where's Mummy?

677
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,000
Will anybody help me here?

678
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,750
You can dance later.
Let's move it.

679
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,840
Where were you?

680
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,600
What?

681
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,640
Where were you?

682
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,420
There's a special
arrangement in that car.

683
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,220
What arrangement? Take me there.

684
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,040
What?

685
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,690
Take me to that car.

686
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,690
Take me there!

687
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,850
Have you forgotten who
gave you your first drink?

688
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,270
Brother?

689
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Get me a cigarette.

690
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,870
What did you say?

691
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,280
Give me a fag.

692
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,680
Hey, give me a cigarette.

693
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,850
I don't smoke, Uncle.

694
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,810
Here, take this.

695
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,090
Hope he didn't get hit on the head
by one of those black cauliflowers.

696
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,480
Get lost.

697
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,880
What's wrong with you people?

698
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm waiting to go and get married...

699
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,040
and everyone's busy showing
off their dance moves.

700
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,660
To hell with all of you.

701
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,590
Lead this horse, brother.

702
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,020
I don't need them.
I'll get married by myself.

703
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,900
Lead the horse from that
side and go straight to the altar.

704
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,930
Move aside.

705
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,740
You are our daughter-in-law!

706
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,410
Won't you seek our blessings first?

707
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,800
Let me get married first, Uncle.

708
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,100
Then I'll seek blessings
from all of you.

709
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,090
Let's go.

710
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,440
Ashok's already there, right?

711
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,340
Yes, he's inside.

712
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,400
Come inside, everyone.
Goggle has already gone in.

713
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,160
Welcome. Hello.

714
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,130
He is my...

715
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,150
What happened?

716
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,730
You go. Go back to Delhi.

717
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,510
Are you goin' crazy?

718
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,650
I'm having such a blast.
Your family is so cool.

719
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,580
They are not cool at all.

720
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,240
Papa has been staring
at us the entire evening.

721
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,930
What has he done? To be your father.

722
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,420
Just given a single sperm!

723
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,580
Yes.

724
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,470
And I have to pay for that
single sperm all my life, Kartik.

725
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,730
You should leave.

726
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,620
You should take the next train.

727
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,930
Don't be crazy.

728
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,020
You are not to blame
for his behaviour.

729
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,180
I'll leave at dawn,
before anyone wakes up.

730
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,210
The way he's looking at us,

731
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,210
I don't know when we'll
see each other next.

732
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,770
Dance the night away with me.

733
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,580
Take your hands off, Kartik.
I'm not in the mood for dancing.

734
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,920
I'll get you in the mood.

735
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,150
Like always.

736
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,770
Come on, let's go.

737
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,290
I'll see you inside.

738
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,930
You'll have to handle it,
if things go wrong.

739
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,250
Bro!

740
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,150
Play something cool for my entry.

741
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,200
It should be sexy AF.

742
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,900
Putting up with your tantrums

743
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,540
And whims day and night

744
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,890
Putting up with your tantrums

745
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,660
And whims day and night

746
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,030
I roam around
With a broken heart

747
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,730
This dude is in love with you

748
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,870
This dude is in love with you

749
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,040
Stop me if you can

750
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,530
This dude is scared of none

751
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,600
This dude is in love with you

752
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,870
Our bond cannot be broken

753
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,780
I'll give up the world
but won't give you up

754
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,130
Our bond cannot be broken

755
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,950
I'll give up the world
but won't give you up

756
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,740
This dude gives you his word

757
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,010
This dude is in love with you

758
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,980
I can let go of this world

759
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,530
But this dude won't let go of you

760
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,480
This dude is in love with you

761
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,820
This dude is in love with you

762
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,890
Yes, this dude is crazy about you

763
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,840
What the f*&^!

764
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,570
Mummy...

765
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,780
Chaman!

766
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,560
Yes?

767
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,560
Do something, Chaman.

768
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,810
What can I do?

769
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,360
Why do I have to deal with 'out
of syllabus' questions, every time?

770
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,690
[CHANTS MANTRAS]

771
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,920
[CHANTS MANTRAS]

772
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,950
Everyone, please bow down

773
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,830
with folded hands.

774
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,560
We have been blessed.

775
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:24,950
A miracle.

776
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,020
It's our family tradition.

777
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,730
When... a girl gets married,
her elder brother...

778
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,620
and his best friend...

779
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,600
welcome... everyone like this.

780
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,830
Right.

781
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,110
Like this?

782
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,000
Yes.

783
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,550
But they are...

784
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,920
Kissing? Yes.

785
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,280
Not all kisses are romantic, you know.

786
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,480
Some kisses are formal ones.

787
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,950
But this one's on the lips.

788
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,050
Doesn't look formal to me.

789
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,650
You are not aware of our customs.

790
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:15,100
They're actually
exchanging cardamom seeds.

791
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,130
Right.

792
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,450
With their mouth?

793
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,350
Yes.

794
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,900
It's very auspicious.

795
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,580
It blesses the newly married couple.

796
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,510
That's enough.

797
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,260
Are you done exchanging?

798
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,020
Done!

799
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,130
They're done!

800
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,560
Congratulations!

801
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,370
Come, let's start
with the wedding rituals.

802
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:34,890
Let's start.

803
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,780
Come here, son.

804
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,650
- Please join us.
- Let's go.

805
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,850
That's enough.

806
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,480
You've done exactly as I had expected.

807
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,580
Enough.

808
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,990
Chaman!

809
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,700
Yes, Brother?

810
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,890
Chaman, take this boy away.

811
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,850
Put him into a train and
make sure he doesn't come back.

812
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,030
But, I have to give away my daughter,
according to the rituals.

813
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,990
I've been waiting for all these years.

814
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,080
I'll give her away. It's no big deal.

815
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,020
Come on, I'll see you off.

816
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,590
Let me just talk to Aman, okay?

817
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,820
No way!

818
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,260
Let me just speak to him, Uncle! Bro!

819
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,850
- Let me speak to him once.
- No way!

820
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,830
- I'll just say bye from afar.
- No way!

821
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,340
Can I say a final goodbye, please?

822
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,870
Move aside.

823
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,650
You'll have to fight me for this.

824
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,330
I don't want to fight with you.

825
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,060
You may not know this,

826
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,850
we fight many battles
every day in our lives.

827
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,850
But the battles we
fight against our family,

828
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,030
are the toughest and
the most dangerous ones.

829
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,650
Take Arjun, for instance.

830
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,220
Mr. Mathur's son?

831
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,290
Is he also in your gang?

832
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,310
Come on, he's talking
about Arjun from Mahabharata.

833
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,950
You're going on a tangent here.

834
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,550
My daughter's getting married now.

835
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,050
General knowledge questions
are the last thing on my mind.

836
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,150
Why don't you record your speech
on a voice message and send it to us?

837
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,350
We'll get the entire family
to sit and listen to it.

838
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,430
Please, let's just go now.

839
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,020
Okay, let's go.

840
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,640
Pay up.

841
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,270
For what?

842
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,530
No matter what the world labels us.

843
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,050
We still have to
pay for a train ticket.

844
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,850
Here.

845
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,780
Hunger... will also strike me.

846
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,730
Obviously.

847
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,790
Here.

848
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,460
Covers the GST as well.

849
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,500
By the way Uncle Bro, be nice to him.

850
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,890
He's your son. He's just like you.

851
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,980
A hard nut.

852
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,140
Hey!

853
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,310
Chaman, get him out of here!

854
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,350
Get this disaster away from here!

855
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,160
Stay there till the
train leaves the platform.

856
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,130
Okay!

857
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,740
What... what are you doing?

858
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,840
Royal salutes... for
my father's bravery.

859
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,770
What do you mean?

860
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,920
Goggle?

861
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,410
Goggle?

862
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,040
- Sunaina, Goggle...
- Stop her!

863
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,280
They stopped the wedding midway!

864
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,780
Stop right there.
This wedding cannot take place.

865
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,350
What is the problem, Sushil?

866
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,520
If the elders are okay with it,
where's the problem?

867
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,740
Ashok is the eldest
member of our family.

868
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,130
And he has decided not to marry her.

869
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,440
That's it. Please leave.

870
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,300
But why?

871
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,870
Your boy likes boys.

872
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,360
Uncle, your son is gay.

873
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,930
Dad has refused to
go ahead with the wedding.

874
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,410
We don't want a stepmother.

875
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,060
You may leave now.

876
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,600
It's a mistake.
It's not like that. Brother!

877
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,030
Aman!

878
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,030
Tell me something, son...

879
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,740
When did you decide,
you'll be like this?

880
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,220
What?

881
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,520
I mean... this.

882
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,670
It's called being gay.

883
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,200
Same thing.

884
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,400
When did you decide it?

885
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,940
When did you decide, you won't be gay?

886
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,870
What's there to decide?

887
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,440
I'm born this way.

888
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,700
Really?

889
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,070
You have a valid point.

890
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,050
Do your parents know?

891
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,000
Stop.

892
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:24,820
Go on.

893
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,560
I'll take your leave, Uncle.

894
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,910
We'll meet again, if destined.

895
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,270
Remember one thing...

896
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,780
if you hurt Aman,

897
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:50,860
I'll find your address
and hunt you down.

898
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,800
Tell Shankar Tripathi,
if he wants to play god

899
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,590
...I can exert my powers as well.

900
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,060
Hello Champa, all well?

901
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,900
Are the wedding rituals over?

902
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,460
No...

903
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,560
Why are you crying?

904
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,850
Have you sent her off already?

905
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,750
Our...

906
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,080
I can't understand.

907
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,960
You are crying so much.

908
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,270
Give the phone to someone else.

909
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,480
- Uncle?
- Yes, Keshav?

910
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,700
Goggle took off.

911
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,850
But why?

912
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:42,800
Why did she take off with Ashok?

913
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,310
I was getting them married.

914
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,310
Not with Ashok,
she took off with the horse.

915
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,340
The horse?

916
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,880
Ashok's family called off the wedding,
that's why.

917
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Called it off?
I'll slap you for this nonsense.

918
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,920
I'm reaching in two minutes.

919
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,580
She took off?

920
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,880
When the hell will this train arrive?

921
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,580
The train will be here soon.

922
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,830
Recite the poem, son.

923
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,130
Jack and Jill went up the hill

924
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,200
To fetch a pail of water.

925
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,970
Jack fell down and broke his crown,

926
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,580
Jill came tumbling after.

927
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,010
- Very good.
- It's wrong.

928
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,510
This poem is wrong.

929
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,990
Jack and Johnny went up the hill,

930
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,540
To live in love and laughter.

931
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,710
Jack got thrashed by his dad,

932
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,340
And Johnny hid soon after.

933
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,580
This is the right one.

934
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,910
What's wrong with you?

935
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,160
Why are you teaching him this rubbish?

936
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,420
What's wrong in this, Uncle?

937
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,640
Why does it have to be Jill,
who Jack always climbs the hill with?

938
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,920
Why can't Jack go with Johnny?

939
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,430
How do I know?

940
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,460
This is what is written in the books.

941
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,610
Has anyone ever asked
Jack whom he wants to go with?

942
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,440
Jill or Johnny?

943
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,870
That's why I am saying:

944
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,840
Jack and Johnny went up the hill,

945
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,750
To live in love and laughter.

946
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,640
Jack got thrashed by his dad,

947
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,690
And Johnny hid soon after.

948
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,540
Jack and Johnny went up the hill,

949
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,980
To live in love and laughter.

950
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,300
Jack got thrashed by his dad,

951
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,020
And Johnny hid soon after.

952
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,530
Jack and Johnny went up the hill,

953
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,780
To live in love and laughter.

954
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,900
Jack got thrashed by his dad,

955
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,610
And Johnny hid soon after.

956
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,250
Jack and Johnny went up the hill,

957
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,640
To live in love and laughter.

958
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,030
Jack got thrashed by his dad,

959
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,670
And Johnny hid soon...

960
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,240
Brother?

961
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,450
Goggle has run away.

962
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,220
We'll see.

963
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,170
What do you mean, 'we'll see'?

964
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,820
We can't find her.

965
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,700
Should we deal with
someone we can't find,

966
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,570
or do we deal with what
we have just found out?

967
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,410
Really!

968
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,320
Let's go, your highness!

969
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,300
Wait a minute, Brother.

970
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,380
She is my daughter.

971
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,150
Here, I'm trying to save
our family from embarrassment...

972
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,250
...and you're going on
and on about your daughter.

973
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,820
She's the one who decided
to run away, isn't it?

974
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,840
She'll return when she decides to.

975
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,710
All daughters belong
to someone else, anyway.

976
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,560
Put some sense into his head.

977
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,540
Let's go.

978
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,110
So when will that 'someone'
come and take her away?

979
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,570
What is this, Bhabhi?

980
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,720
- Why the sudden change?
- Bhabhi.

981
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,610
What if that 'someone' is no one?

982
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,510
You can't stop everyone.

983
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,930
People will talk.

984
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,060
We can't stop them.

985
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,710
Your misdeeds have
ruined Goggle's life.

986
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,820
It will ruin our family next.

987
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,410
Isn't it?

988
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,140
Why will this ruin our family?
I don't understand.

989
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,420
We are such a big family.

990
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,150
Who cares,
whose son is sleeping with whom?

991
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,190
What do you mean 'sleeping with'?

992
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,150
You'd said that you're
merely in love with him.

993
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,910
So, I'm allowed to love
him but not sleep with him?

994
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,910
Why are you going off on a tangent?

995
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,400
They must be roommates.

996
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,040
You are roommates, right?

997
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,530
I used to sleep with
Chaman when we were younger.

998
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:52,380
Sometimes in his sleep, he'd put
his legs on me, that doesn't mean...

999
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,310
In your sleep,
if you accidentally touch someone...

1000
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,040
...it's not that
...what you think it is.

1001
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,420
You are mistaken.
Nothing happened.

1002
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,240
You are fine.

1003
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,010
He's fine!

1004
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:03,560
Yes, he is fine.

1005
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,690
Come on, Papa, I'm not mistaken.

1006
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,530
It's as if you want to pee
and I tell you that you're mistaken.

1007
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,940
Is that even possible?

1008
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,260
There's a difference between
peeing and loving, isn't there?

1009
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,330
The body has physical needs.

1010
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,130
What?

1011
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,730
Have you ever been in love?

1012
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:18,800
So what's left?

1013
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,450
Peeing.

1014
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,590
There is a science
behind wanting to pee.

1015
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,670
Proper science.

1016
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,940
Yes Papa, there is a
science behind loving as well.

1017
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,850
Proper science.

1018
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,560
Love is not a readymade
drink that you can just gulp down.

1019
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,880
Mummy, the first time I saw Kartik,
it grew big.

1020
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,720
Huh?

1021
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,850
My eyes. My eyes grew big!

1022
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,740
This happens when you're in love.

1023
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,730
There's a science behind this.

1024
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,190
At his mere touch, there was
an explosion of dopamine in my body.

1025
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,440
Dopamine?

1026
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,270
- It's a kind of...
- It's something our body secretes.

1027
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,540
When you're in love,
it's released by the body.

1028
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,540
I feel so stressed
when I'm away from him.

1029
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,410
It happens because of corticotrophin.

1030
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,530
Ohh!

1031
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,330
Who are you reminded of?
Why are you sighing?

1032
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,200
Kumar.

1033
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,730
I'd tried telling you about him before
we got married, but you wouldn't listen.

1034
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,270
Why are you getting angry at Mummy?

1035
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,530
Just because you couldn't
be with the one you loved...

1036
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,060
...doesn't mean you will
hate people who fall in love.

1037
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,450
Have you forgotten
about your Yezdi bike?

1038
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,040
You were about to elope...
against everybody's wishes with...

1039
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,710
What was her name?
Rani Asthana.

1040
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,950
I wanted to. But I didn't elope.

1041
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,920
I married someone my
family wanted me to marry.

1042
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,110
They succeeded in
stopping the wedding,

1043
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,580
but, were they able to
stop you from being in love?

1044
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,050
Papa, the first time I kissed Kartik,
in a cab...

1045
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,410
...there was a burst
of cortisol in my body.

1046
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,750
You must have experienced the same

1047
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,040
when you kissed the one you loved,
for the first time.

1048
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,090
What about you, Mummy?

1049
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:47,800
Shut up.

1050
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,060
Why do you want him to shut up?

1051
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,060
Let him talk.

1052
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,490
Yes, I was in love once.

1053
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,910
But with a girl.

1054
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:53,780
A woman.

1055
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,290
You are in love with a boy.

1056
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,260
A man!

1057
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,840
What f&*king difference does it make?

1058
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,470
What?

1059
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,320
Did you just swear?

1060
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,880
I am his father and...

1061
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,240
I am. Right?

1062
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,410
Of course, you are.

1063
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,280
I'd just held hands with him.

1064
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,990
I had stopped swearing so
that you wouldn't learn those words.

1065
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,700
And this is how you talk to me?

1066
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,790
It's not me,
it's the oxytocin talking.

1067
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,360
It is manufactured in the
hypothalamus when you are in love.

1068
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,170
It gives you goose bumps
and fires you from within.

1069
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,590
Your behaviour changes and
you don't give a damn about anyone,

1070
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,340
even if it's your father
standing in front of you.

1071
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,080
How do I make my
hypothalamus understand?

1072
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,970
That Kartik is a boy and so am I.

1073
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,670
And that this should not
make a difference to anyone else.

1074
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,200
- But son...
- Papa.

1075
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,210
Aman...

1076
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,380
We will get you treated.

1077
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,730
There is nothing medical
science can't do nowadays.

1078
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,580
Right?

1079
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,100
You'll be fine.

1080
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,430
Sure, Mummy.

1081
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,430
Your oxytocin signals love
and mine signals a disease?

1082
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,760
Aman!

1083
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,010
Sunaina, take off your sari.

1084
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,040
You're upset, again?

1085
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,140
I can't do this again.

1086
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,960
Sunaina, listen to me.
Take off your sari.

1087
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:19,300
Somebody should think about
people who want to commit suicide.

1088
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,400
Have a heart, you rascals!

1089
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,710
What are you doing, Goggle?

1090
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,670
Have you gone mad?

1091
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,040
I want to kill myself.

1092
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,040
But why?

1093
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,260
My wedding was called off.

1094
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,390
All because of you.

1095
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,950
So you want to kill yourself
just because of that?

1096
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,210
It's important to marry
to have a fulfilled life.

1097
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,830
But one can die alone, right?

1098
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,750
Enough now.

1099
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,060
This is crazy.

1100
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,530
All you've been talking
about is marriage!

1101
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:37,790
- Did you ask me before...
-Shut up.

1102
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,930
Be quiet.

1103
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,520
No one will talk about marriage here.

1104
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,600
It's as if marriage is
like a course of antibiotics...

1105
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,040
something you must complete.

1106
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,460
So what, if the wedding is called off?

1107
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,020
Why do you want to die?

1108
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,760
I was 15 when my boyfriend
tried to kiss me.

1109
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,690
Seeing my fake eye freaked him out.

1110
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,450
I've been waiting ever since.

1111
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:58,220
Show it to me again!

1112
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,760
Whoa, Conjuring!

1113
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,340
He must've been shit scared.

1114
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,500
We were on the terrace
and I pushed him off.

1115
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,960
Now he is missing a
leg and I am missing an eye.

1116
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,430
I felt guilty about it and
had to treat him like a brother.

1117
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,450
Aman's father kept behaving like this

1118
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,540
and now, you're behaving like this.

1119
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,420
The entire family is bonkers.

1120
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,370
Yes, we are.

1121
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,260
Aman, your father is
trying to hang himself!

1122
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,420
What are you up to?

1123
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,540
Give me a minute.

1124
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,560
Aman!

1125
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,920
What happened?

1126
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,890
It's our personal matter.

1127
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,850
He is trying to commit suicide.

1128
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,140
We'll solve this in five minutes.

1129
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,870
Hurry up, Aman!

1130
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,640
Move. Move.

1131
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:33,580
Shit!

1132
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,270
What are you doing?

1133
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,270
You don't even know
how to commit suicide.

1134
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,360
Aman will be right here.

1135
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,070
Why are you in such a hurry?

1136
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,610
You could have done this at home.

1137
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,220
It's a personal matter.
It will be over in two minutes.

1138
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:49,730
Wait, Goggle.

1139
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,000
Where are you going?

1140
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,470
To lie on the train tracks.

1141
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,640
Don't!

1142
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,210
Don't do that.

1143
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,510
Why are you doing this?

1144
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,740
You have your family to support you.

1145
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,870
All I had was... a shadow of a father.

1146
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,740
When I met all of
you for the first time,

1147
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,520
I realised that I wanted
to be a part of this family.

1148
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,790
This is the family
I want to get married into.

1149
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,410
If you love him so much, why are you
running away and leaving him all alone?

1150
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,610
I don't have anyone to love.
But you do.

1151
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,870
You'll never be happy,
if you run away now.

1152
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,860
Nor would Aman.

1153
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,680
You knew about it?

1154
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,130
Yeah, since childhood.

1155
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,200
He had such big dreams for you.

1156
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,470
He has done so much for you.

1157
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,100
And this is how you repay it?

1158
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,240
What are you punishing us for?

1159
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,690
We've never asked anything from you?

1160
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,210
Have we?

1161
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,100
If you don't want to live here, fine.

1162
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,510
We'll buy you a place in Delhi.

1163
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,700
You don't need to
send any money back home.

1164
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,440
But please listen to your father.

1165
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,110
We have chosen Kusum as your bride.

1166
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:09,970
She is a good girl.

1167
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,360
She's a girl.

1168
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,740
Agree to marry her.

1169
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,090
Goggle, let's go.

1170
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,370
Where?

1171
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,470
To your place.

1172
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,260
To my future in-laws.

1173
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,770
I'm coming, Aman,

1174
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,280
to set off some fireworks
in the Tripathi family.

1175
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,090
We deserve
a happy ending as well.

1176
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,380
After all that dance and
drama my knees are acting up.

1177
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,620
Your knees are just as useless
as your black cauliflowers.

1178
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,840
Should we have let him have his way?

1179
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:02,600
Aman's our son, after all.

1180
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,510
He's yours.

1181
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,580
Our own.

1182
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,020
Just like Goggle was.

1183
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,410
Champa! Champa!

1184
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,600
I meant... she is, will always be.

1185
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,890
I'm sure Goggle is here, somewhere.

1186
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,690
Be patient, Chaman.
Everything will be fine.

1187
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,510
Chaman, what I meant is,

1188
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,460
Aman's problem is affecting us all.

1189
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,580
And together we'll have
to find a miracle cure.

1190
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,020
Uncle!

1191
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,420
I found something on Google.

1192
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,420
It clearly states that being
gay is not a kind of disease.

1193
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,200
See this.

1194
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,320
Whose side are you on?
This Google's or ours?

1195
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,930
The Tripathis have been
here way before 3G and 4G arrived.

1196
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,290
Go and sit in the bus.

1197
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,950
Chaman...

1198
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,000
You have no sense of timing.

1199
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:44,920
But...

1200
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,600
'The issue of black cauliflowers has
taken a political turn in Allahabad.'

1201
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,960
'It is said, because of this problem
the farmers are turning to violence.'

1202
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,750
'It has resulted in
a curfew in Allahabad.'

1203
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,870
Nobody from the Tripathi clan
has brought disgrace to the family.

1204
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,890
And look at you, you've brought
the entire city to its knees.

1205
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:44,530
Are you crazy?

1206
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,740
Don't worry.

1207
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,080
I'll fix your problem.

1208
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,970
Fix me?

1209
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,920
I am not some machine
that needs fixing.

1210
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,910
I know what to do.

1211
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,820
One minute.

1212
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,000
Don't come so close.

1213
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,180
Go and sit over there.

1214
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,520
Okay?

1215
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:08,980
With your chutzpah and my belief,
I'm sure we'll hit it off.

1216
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,810
What?

1217
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,330
Hit what?

1218
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,870
Will you hit the ball out of the park,
after marriage?

1219
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,120
Will there be billboards on us?

1220
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,530
At the most, you'll have
more kids than the usual two.

1221
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,590
Those kids will grow up thinking
they can hit it off, as well.

1222
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,440
But in this country, kids get
hit way before they can hit it off.

1223
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,280
You still have time.

1224
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,060
Refuse to get married to me.

1225
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,200
Else, it won't be a hit,
it'll be a miss.

1226
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,770
I won't refuse to the marriage.

1227
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,410
You're only concerned
with your own problem.

1228
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,550
Listen, I maybe gay,
but this is not a problem for me.

1229
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,920
Maybe not for you,
but it is a problem for your parents.

1230
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,890
As soon as we get home,
I'll call Panditji

1231
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:44,900
and get a pooja to mark
Aman's rebirth as a man.

1232
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,140
It will solve everything.

1233
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,580
It will be the first of its kind,
in Allahabad.

1234
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,500
Okay?

1235
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,560
That's a great idea.

1236
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,440
Isn't it?

1237
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,910
Let me tell Chaman about this.

1238
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,050
Chaman!

1239
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,100
Aunty!

1240
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,650
He has gone to pee.

1241
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,360
See, you are my last hope.

1242
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,530
Please, don't refuse to marry me.

1243
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,870
It's my request, please.

1244
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,920
Aman!

1245
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,800
It's a long journey.

1246
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,560
Why don't you go ahead
and do it on all our behalf?

1247
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,570
What you are doing is wrong.

1248
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,900
Really?

1249
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,520
Now I'll have to learn how to pee,
from you?

1250
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,740
Who am I to teach you anything?
I am younger to you.

1251
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,790
The elders have mastered the art of
peeing all over our hopes and desires.

1252
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,580
Come on, which hope
of yours have I dampened?

1253
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,360
Sort out your own issues.

1254
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,810
You sort out your issues first.

1255
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:54,400
Your daughter has run away from home.

1256
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,770
It's all because of your son.

1257
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:57,950
He is the reason she has done this.

1258
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:58,790
No, no.

1259
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,820
That's not the real reason.

1260
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,930
The real reason is that you
were unable to find a groom for her.

1261
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:07,380
You seem to have forgotten that she
lost her eye because of your airgun.

1262
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,200
Because she lost an eye,
nobody wants to marry her.

1263
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,100
Great.

1264
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,440
And this is how you took your revenge?

1265
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,700
You think I ruined
your daughter's life,

1266
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,840
so you ruined my son's?

1267
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,370
Isn't it?

1268
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:22,310
All those CDs with dirty
movies that you'd keep in your room,

1269
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,010
Aman would secretly watch them all.

1270
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:27,020
There were girls,
featured in those movies.

1271
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,940
But your son is interested in boys.

1272
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,400
Only girls, huh?

1273
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,820
We need evidence here.

1274
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,690
Mr. Lawyer, why are you silent now?

1275
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:35,990
Were there only girls, in those films?

1276
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,930
No!

1277
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,510
There were boys as well.

1278
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,100
How would I know, he'd be
more interested in looking at boys?

1279
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,280
Don't blame me for Aman's behaviour.

1280
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,020
Think of the past.

1281
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,120
Who introduced me to such movies?

1282
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:48,970
You did!

1283
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:52,910
What about those magazines with
dirty pictures, that you'd keep hidden?

1284
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:53,880
Debo-Nair?

1285
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,630
What about those?

1286
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:56,730
Not Debo-Nair, it's Debonair!

1287
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,560
At least pronounce it properly.

1288
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,790
Don't change the topic.

1289
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,120
It's all your fault.

1290
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,990
That's all.

1291
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,950
You dog, I used to get those
magazines for Shashikant Uncle.

1292
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,280
But all of us would enjoy them,
wouldn't we?

1293
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,500
It's Uncle's mistake!

1294
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,610
Have you lost your mind?

1295
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,910
Leave him.

1296
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,360
At least pull up your zips,
before you fight, both of you.

1297
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,790
Let's go.

1298
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:24,790
You are right.

1299
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,450
This taunt of yours...
has really hurt me.

1300
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,490
So you are saying,
it is Uncle's mistake.

1301
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,660
Let me promise you one thing.

1302
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,750
From now on, no uncle in
the family will make such a mistake.

1303
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,630
Let's go, Champa.

1304
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,230
Wash your hands before touching me.

1305
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,610
Go on.

1306
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,410
Sunaina, this stinks of revolt.

1307
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,680
The stink... is coming from the pee.

1308
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,690
Let's go.

1309
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,190
Aman is alone with Kusum.

1310
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,680
Last night when I found
out that you are gay...

1311
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,130
I was thrilled.

1312
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,050
But why?

1313
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:05,530
You're the first one
to be thrilled about this.

1314
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,210
May I ask, why?

1315
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:12,520
Actually,
I'm in love with someone else.

1316
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:13,830
What?

1317
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:19,240
You're in love with someone else
and that's why you want to marry me?

1318
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:20,890
Why?

1319
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,290
I mean, who is this person?

1320
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,380
Rakesh.

1321
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,130
Sounds unique.

1322
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,190
Doesn't it?

1323
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,130
He is a simple guy.

1324
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,990
He steals cars in Meerut.

1325
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,260
In fact,
he's also accused of a murder.

1326
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,330
But love is blind, you know.

1327
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,220
But he has sworn on his
mother that he didn't do it.

1328
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,770
What? Love?

1329
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,020
The murder.

1330
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,200
He really loves me.

1331
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,450
It's my parents who don't like him.

1332
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,320
Parents can be crazy, right?

1333
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,310
He's such a simple guy
and they still don't like him!

1334
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,740
Are you making fun of me?

1335
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:57,790
Did you get Kartik to
sign an application form,

1336
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,250
before you fell in love with him?

1337
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,460
My parents' problem is that
Rakesh belongs to a different caste.

1338
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,580
Sorry.

1339
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,370
You don't need to feel guilty.

1340
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,820
You have enough problems of your own.

1341
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,350
I have an offer.

1342
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,140
You are gay.
Alright?

1343
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,810
Marry me.

1344
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,030
We'll settle down in Delhi.

1345
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,810
Rakesh is planning to expand
his business in Delhi, as well.

1346
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,450
So, I'll get married to you,
but I'll live with him.

1347
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,480
And you can go ahead
and live with Kartik.

1348
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,340
Have you lost it?

1349
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,420
Why don't you elope with him?
Why are you involving me?

1350
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,380
If I elope, I'll miss
out on getting the jewellery.

1351
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,750
Just think over it, for a few minutes.

1352
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,230
You will have full
freedom after marriage.

1353
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,050
How many people are as lucky?

1354
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,790
Tell me.

1355
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,540
Oh no, your parents
are coming this way.

1356
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,610
Tell me if you agree or not.

1357
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:50,340
Yes or no?

1358
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,180
Yes or no!

1359
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:51,970
No!

1360
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,620
That means yes.

1361
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,550
If a girl's refusal is
assumed to be her consent,

1362
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,910
the same applies to you as well.

1363
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,280
Thank you!

1364
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,510
Get away!

1365
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,310
Why don't you eat something, Aman?

1366
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,550
Don't irritate me.

1367
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,910
Romeo was a city boy

1368
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,310
While Juliet was a village belle

1369
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:32,240
There's no way the two of them
Could be together, the society decreed

1370
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,400
Romeo was a city boy

1371
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,140
While Juliet was a village belle

1372
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,040
There's no way the two of them

1373
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,170
Could be together, the society decreed

1374
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,220
They were so much in love

1375
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,190
That she ran away from home

1376
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,240
There was chaos everywhere

1377
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,870
And their love set the village ablaze

1378
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:58,900
Bringing their morality
to a nought, my dear

1379
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,800
Bringing their morality
to a nought, my dear

1380
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,220
Bringing their morality
to a nought, my dear

1381
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,110
Congratulations.

1382
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,370
We have a boy.

1383
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,880
Normal delivery.

1384
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,930
What's this new drama, Mummy?

1385
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,110
You're a newborn.
You can't talk just yet.

1386
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,400
You can just cry.

1387
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,120
Look at my face.
I'm doing just that.

1388
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,560
Be quiet, or your father
will threaten us with suicide again.

1389
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,150
Have you thought of a
new name for your newborn son?

1390
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,180
Chandravadhan.

1391
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,850
Chandravadhan Tripathi.

1392
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,060
Henceforth, Aman will be
known as Chandravadhan Tripathi.

1393
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,960
Aman, our first born, has left us.

1394
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,830
Just wait a little longer, mister.

1395
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,120
The rituals aren't over yet.

1396
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,980
They will be, soon.

1397
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,750
We have done our job,
fulfilled our responsibility.

1398
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,080
What was I saying?

1399
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,180
Aman has left us.

1400
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,360
We don't know where he is.

1401
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,770
In fact, we don't even want to know.

1402
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:43,830
He is dead for us.

1403
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:45,980
We have conducted his last rites.

1404
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,700
And done away with his bad habits...

1405
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,440
The fact is, Chandravadhan Tripathi
is all set to start his life anew.

1406
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,950
Please give him your blessings.

1407
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,200
Nonsense!

1408
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:06,620
He should have done this
for our daughter as well.

1409
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:07,680
Shut up.

1410
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,160
Who could it be?

1411
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,280
- During a curfew?
- I don't know.

1412
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,620
- Let me see.
- No, Champa.

1413
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,900
It could be those
black cauliflowers again.

1414
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,930
But they fall from above, Uncle.

1415
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,090
You haven't created ones
that walk through the door, yet.

1416
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,550
Goggle is back!

1417
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,860
Not here.
Let's go there.

1418
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,540
Goggle!

1419
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,630
Let's go.

1420
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:35,940
Goggle!

1421
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,500
No one even bothered
to come looking for me.

1422
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,980
Goggle is...

1423
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,720
Brother...

1424
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,490
What happened to Aman?

1425
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,670
Don't worry, Goggle.
Everything is fine.

1426
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:55,490
See, that's him, standing right there.

1427
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,000
I've been trying to convince
your parents for the last two days.

1428
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,170
That you are fine.

1429
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,720
They need not worry.

1430
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,880
We have raised you well.

1431
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,760
I can't tell you how happy I am,
to see you.

1432
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:13,040
There were minor problems,
but everything will be okay now.

1433
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,960
Our family will come
together and prepare for

1434
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,890
Chandravadhan and Kusum's wedding.

1435
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,040
Hey, what are you racing towards?
The finish line?

1436
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,500
Aman.

1437
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,330
In the past.

1438
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,810
He has been reborn.

1439
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:37,120
Sorry Uncle, I have no
idea what you guys are up to.

1440
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:41,970
Don't feel bad,
but the cause of your problems...

1441
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,380
is up there.

1442
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:48,800
Who is playing the music?

1443
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:51,000
Oh shit.

1444
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,720
Chaman!

1445
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,710
Are you coming or not, Chaman?

1446
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,660
Who is it?

1447
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,940
Who is up there?

1448
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,160
Who is playing the music?

1449
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,290
Oh God!

1450
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,000
Chaman, catch that pigeon.

1451
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,620
I am sure Karthik
must be behind all this.

1452
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,180
I won't.

1453
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,640
Chaman, catch that pigeon!

1454
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:16,950
I won't do your bidding anymore.

1455
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:20,390
You're always ordering me around.

1456
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,810
From now on, everyone will
solve their problems, by themselves.

1457
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,280
Is this how you talk
to your elder brother, Chaman?

1458
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,220
Enough, Bhabhi.

1459
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,510
I refuse to play the sidekick anymore.

1460
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,890
I'll get my degree in
law and play the lead role.

1461
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,110
Did you see...

1462
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,110
Yes, got it!

1463
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,730
I told you, I'll catch you.

1464
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,960
You should look over there.

1465
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,860
Friends!

1466
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,360
Shankar Tripathi is ill.

1467
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,880
Very ill.

1468
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,340
That man who is featured
in the 'smoking kills' ad...

1469
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,680
Mukesh!

1470
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,070
He's way more sick than that man is.

1471
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,590
It was only Mukesh's
lungs that are affected.

1472
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:14,360
But Shankar Tripathi's lungs,
liver, heart and brain...

1473
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,280
...has been taken over
by a dangerous disease.

1474
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,280
This disease is called...

1475
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:20,790
Homophobia!

1476
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,030
Homophobia!

1477
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,610
Homophobia!

1478
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,450
Sounds like a Dolby kind of disease.

1479
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,470
Yes.

1480
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,100
And this disease has no cure.

1481
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,040
What nonsense is this?

1482
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,370
I had told you to make
sure he gets on that train.

1483
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:37,970
Where are you all going?

1484
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,750
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.

1485
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,430
This disease is not contagious.

1486
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,140
This disease only affects the mind.

1487
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,310
Stop him.

1488
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:49,010
Unfortunately this
is not a killer disease...

1489
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,160
But...

1490
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,410
What are you doing? Let him go.

1491
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:52,830
the diseased man becomes a killer.

1492
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,140
There will be films on him.

1493
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:59,370
His story will be oft repeated.

1494
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,570
Shankar Tripathi will
be featured on the news.

1495
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:07,150
And one day, Shankar Deenanath
Tripathi will turn into a zombie.

1496
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,530
Zombie!

1497
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:09,830
He'll be a zombie.

1498
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,590
He'll be... a zombie.

1499
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,730
Now that you're back,
I'll deal with you.

1500
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,550
Stay right here.

1501
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,070
Don't leave.

1502
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,500
I'll be back in two minutes.

1503
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:32,650
In two minutes.

1504
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,900
He's fooling around, Papa.
I'll deal with him.

1505
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,360
No, son, no one will say a word.

1506
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:40,240
He has brought this disease here.

1507
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,810
And he will take it back with him.

1508
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,270
Papa, I...

1509
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,440
- Listen...
- No...

1510
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,310
Mummy, why don't you
say something to him?

1511
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:50,630
You always have something to say.

1512
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,700
What can I say?

1513
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,560
After what you've done,
is there anything left for me to say?

1514
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,450
What is he doing wrong?

1515
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,060
You are the one who left
home and changed yourself.

1516
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,230
But we're still the same.

1517
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,090
Please stop this drama, Aunty.

1518
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,950
I hope he doesn't own a gun.

1519
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,870
If he does, I have a few last
wishes that you could fulfil for me.

1520
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,340
I really need to pee, man.

1521
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,920
What are you doing?

1522
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,280
I was handling everything.

1523
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,200
Don't worry, I'll deal with it.

1524
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,790
I'm a strong guy.

1525
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,980
Uncle, take him away. He's a softie.

1526
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,340
Please stop all this.

1527
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,300
Kartik, stop this drama right now.

1528
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,770
It's not just you,

1529
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,970
everyone has to deal
with this kind of crap, bro.

1530
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,580
You should leave.

1531
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,710
Will you be able to
watch me getting beaten up?

1532
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,090
Yes.

1533
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,250
I will stand right here.

1534
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:41,090
Today you'll find out, a scientist
can hit as hard as a blacksmith can.

1535
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,400
Because that's the way fathers are.

1536
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,890
Paying for that single sperm, huh?

1537
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:47,400
I told you.
I'll have to pay for it, all my life.

1538
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,960
Now that you are here,
stand your ground.

1539
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,800
Don't fall to your knees.

1540
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:02,870
Babe, this guy is crazy about you

1541
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:07,570
He doesn't know if
he's going right or left

1542
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,440
He is willing to brave all odds
For the sake of love

1543
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,990
I devote my life to you
I'm yours, come what may

1544
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:18,030
My love is one of a kind
Don't you see?

1545
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:23,080
What do you do, my love

1546
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,660
When you're away from me?

1547
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:34,650
I sit all alone
Hiding my tears

1548
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:49,640
Every breath I take
Belongs to you

1549
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:55,600
My life will have no meaning
If you lose trust in me

1550
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,480
This world envies what we have

1551
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,900
And tries to break us apart

1552
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,890
I have loved you
Despite what the world had to say

1553
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:13,640
What do you do, my love
When you're away from me?

1554
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:22,290
I sit all alone
Hiding my tears

1555
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,920
My sexuality is my sexuality.

1556
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,080
None of your sexuality.

1557
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,160
He's faking it.

1558
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:55,790
He's still breathing.

1559
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:59,300
You aren't as strong as...

1560
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,210
Father used to be.

1561
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:04,150
If there wasn't a curfew, you
could've taken him to the hospital.

1562
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,350
I wouldn't have said no.

1563
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,440
If there is a police case,
then always remember, I am there.

1564
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,680
Yeah, good way to
catch your first client.

1565
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,520
Let's go, Champa.

1566
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,040
Home?

1567
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,230
Is this really our home anymore?

1568
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,540
Only a part of it is.

1569
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,920
I have to go, Didi is calling me.

1570
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,000
Coming!

1571
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,450
What did you say, Champa?

1572
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,840
- What did she say?
- Got it.

1573
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,160
See this article, Uncle.

1574
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,670
Sex is actually your gender -

1575
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,180
male, female...

1576
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,510
Your physical body.

1577
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:40,110
Sexuality is what
you feel from within.

1578
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:41,030
Simple.

1579
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:41,960
That can be different from gender.

1580
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,490
How can it differ?

1581
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,770
I feel the same way, without
and within, when I feel up your aunt.

1582
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,310
If one is physically male,
how can he be a female from within?

1583
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,670
I found another article on this.

1584
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,900
It is explained in detail,
listen carefully.

1585
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,000
Gender is not merely male or female.

1586
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,050
Your sexuality can lie
anywhere on this spectrum.

1587
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,630
Like, if a woman...

1588
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,890
You broke it, Uncle.

1589
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:11,020
No one will utter the word
'sex' in this house anymore.

1590
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,570
What word won't you use?

1591
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:13,530
Sex.

1592
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,090
Sorry, Uncle.

1593
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,220
I won't.

1594
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:19,900
Where is Aman?

1595
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,640
Won't he eat dinner?

1596
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,120
He has locked himself in his room.

1597
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,340
He hasn't come out
since that incident.

1598
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,530
I hope he hasn't committed suicide.

1599
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:29,770
Shut up.

1600
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,550
I'll go take a look.

1601
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:34,890
I'll come with you, Mummy.

1602
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,930
This boy!

1603
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,730
Have you lost your mind?

1604
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,080
That's what these
youngsters do nowadays.

1605
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,090
It has become a trend.

1606
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,200
Don't blame me.

1607
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,700
This is another one who tried
to kill herself on the rail tracks.

1608
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,260
Don't give me that look.

1609
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,910
I know what you were
doing on that bridge.

1610
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,720
Yes, you know everything.

1611
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,630
But you don't know
why I had gone there.

1612
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,010
Why do youngsters commit suicide?

1613
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,060
Before marriage or after it?

1614
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,350
The father tried to kill himself.

1615
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,470
Now the son is trying to kill himself.

1616
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,940
Maybe I should kill myself
as well and get it over with.

1617
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:07,790
Aman!

1618
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,940
Please open the door!

1619
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:13,510
Don't kill yourself
over something so petty.

1620
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,810
I had to deal with four rejections.

1621
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,030
I didn't run to the
nearest railway tracks.

1622
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:20,750
And you look at you,
taking off on that horse.

1623
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:24,190
Girls, in our time,
were more determined.

1624
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,820
We would make sure
that we grab a husband.

1625
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:27,870
Grab?

1626
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,470
You mean, have a husband.

1627
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,250
You mind your own business.

1628
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,590
Children need to
be motivated nowadays.

1629
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,080
We didn't need this kind of motivation

1630
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,670
although we had problems of our own.

1631
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,260
But you had somebody to talk to.

1632
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:42,550
Who do I have?

1633
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,870
You had somebody to
share your problems with.

1634
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,980
Bade Gulam Ali, the singer.

1635
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,740
I loved listening to his sad songs.

1636
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,330
Aman, open the door!

1637
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:53,190
Mummy, what will I
do if he kills himself?

1638
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,020
Be quiet. Be positive.

1639
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,540
- Aman!
- He's my last hope.

1640
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,840
Son!

1641
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,510
This damn bangle is also stuck.

1642
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:01,930
Try using soap, it'll come off.

1643
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,070
Aman!

1644
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,850
No matter how hopeless it seems,

1645
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:08,480
one day you will find
someone who loves you.

1646
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:09,870
Chaman will find someone fro you.

1647
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,670
I won't let him die before he does.

1648
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:13,070
Let me live in peace until then.

1649
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,120
I don't want to get married.

1650
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,540
Never ever!

1651
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:19,010
I'll throw you out of the
house if you talk like this.

1652
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,410
I dare you to.

1653
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,510
This is my home.

1654
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:22,670
Will you hit me with a stick,

1655
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:24,230
- just like you guys hit him?
- Hey!

1656
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,180
I have a share in this house.

1657
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,690
Forgotten?

1658
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:29,120
Bravo, Chaman!

1659
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,120
If you wanted your
share of the property,

1660
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,310
you should have spoken to me directly.

1661
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:34,700
Why are you making
her speak on your behalf?

1662
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,290
No, Brother.
Never.

1663
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:37,540
What nonsense is this?

1664
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,520
She is right.

1665
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,330
Bravo.

1666
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:42,750
Champa, nothing could
divide the Tripathis,

1667
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:43,860
and nothing will.

1668
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,040
Anyway, there wasn't much to divide.

1669
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,400
But we should divide everything now.

1670
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,130
Else, the children and their children
will end up fighting with each other.

1671
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,030
Your daughter plans to have
children before marriage, does she?

1672
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:55,870
She's 27. I still have hope.

1673
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,880
Thanks to your son, you don't.

1674
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,910
He has brought home
a son-in-law for you.

1675
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,690
How dare you!

1676
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,230
Get him to have children first, then
you can stake a claim to the property.

1677
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,300
- You can call him a man then!
- Be quiet.

1678
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,860
- Mummy, please.
- Be quiet.

1679
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:07,860
Aman!

1680
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,490
- Didi!
- Bhabhi!

1681
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,380
Sunaina!

1682
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,490
What happened, Bhabhi?

1683
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,680
Nothing happened.

1684
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,450
See what Guddu has written.

1685
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,430
See this.

1686
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,420
I promise to marry Kusum,

1687
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:27,750
but Kartik should not be harmed.

1688
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,870
Why are you crying then?

1689
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:30,850
Why did you scream?

1690
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:34,270
I screamed because I was happy.

1691
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,340
Silly woman.

1692
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:39,650
This...

1693
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,310
Is it written in his blood?

1694
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,950
No, it's nail polish.

1695
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,330
My son...

1696
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,400
Where did he go?

1697
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:52,180
Champa, wait and watch, Aman will
get married and have children as well.

1698
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,640
We would love that.

1699
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,470
Unfortunately, our daughter...

1700
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,190
Congratulations, Bhabhi.

1701
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,740
Kusum, you too...

1702
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,750
Let's forget what just happened.

1703
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:08,070
Why drag children into this?

1704
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,710
Things are finally working out well.

1705
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,620
Mummy, play louder.

1706
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,880
It's your daughter's
wedding after all.

1707
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,700
Keep quiet.

1708
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,120
Who holds a wedding during a curfew?

1709
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,710
Shankar Tripathi does.

1710
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:25,230
Had you ever imagined
that your daughter would be...

1711
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,210
...escorted by the police
on her wedding day?

1712
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,170
Have you seen this necklace?

1713
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:31,130
It's real gold.

1714
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,320
There's more jewellery here.

1715
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,530
Show me.

1716
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:34,900
It's mine.

1717
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:40,620
Goggle, why don't
you help me play this?

1718
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,640
By the way Aunty,
my name is Rajni, not Goggle.

1719
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,430
You go ahead and
play the drum yourself.

1720
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,790
You call this a horse?

1721
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,430
She will grow up, soon.

1722
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,070
In a matter of minutes?

1723
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,220
Like in the movies?

1724
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,270
Don't shout, Uncle.

1725
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:58,760
It's her first time.

1726
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,060
She's a virgin.

1727
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,350
I'm not shouting,
I'm merely requesting you.

1728
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,120
We can't step out of
the house during the curfew.

1729
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,910
We'll get her to walk around
the courtyard a few times,

1730
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,260
so that it feels like a real wedding.

1731
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,310
And...

1732
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,550
- Keshav.
- Coming, Uncle.

1733
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:13,290
Here.

1734
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:16,920
Put this on.

1735
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,340
We don't have too many guests.

1736
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:19,790
Feel free to join in the dance.

1737
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:20,780
It's my humble request.

1738
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:25,120
Chaman, what are you waiting for?
Switch the lights on.

1739
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:35,640
Has Article 377 been abolished?

1740
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,980
Wait. What the hell is all this?

1741
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,280
You're getting married?

1742
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,490
To Kusum.

1743
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,500
Who is this Kusum?

1744
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,010
A girl, Kartik.

1745
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:51,700
Are you okay?

1746
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,810
Are you feeling okay?

1747
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:55,040
Haven't you learnt your lesson?

1748
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,050
Don't take stress. Take a deep breath.

1749
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:04,310
I don't want to.

1750
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,740
We'll talk to her... Suman.

1751
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,290
Her name is Kusum, not Suman.

1752
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:09,650
And this was her idea.

1753
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:10,690
Her idea?

1754
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,490
She's in love with someone else.

1755
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,130
Her parents didn't agree to the match.

1756
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,850
Ours would be a fake marriage.

1757
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,300
Why the hell do you want
to play house with her then?

1758
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,330
Six months down the line,
you'll be asked to have a kid.

1759
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,590
One down,
you'll be asked to have another one.

1760
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,540
Can you do it?

1761
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,290
Will you be able to do it
with your 'legally married wife'?

1762
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:27,700
What else can I do?
I'll have to do it.

1763
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,940
I'll have to figure out a
way to deal with this crazy bunch.

1764
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:30,890
OMG!

1765
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:31,750
Way to go.

1766
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,080
What a brilliant idea, you dumbass!

1767
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,870
First, Sunita and you
will fool your parents.

1768
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:37,790
Her name is Kusum.

1769
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,570
Simran and her boyfriend
will then fool her parents.

1770
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:40,410
Her name is Kusum!

1771
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,240
Then your parents will
try and fool the society.

1772
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,460
Then we will fool them.

1773
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,400
At the age of 40, you will realise
that you are the one who has been fooled.

1774
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,600
Go. Get married to Sangeeta.

1775
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,820
I told you, her name is Kusum!

1776
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:50,840
Aman!

1777
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,000
The horse is ready.

1778
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,000
So is the bride.

1779
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:54,600
Her name is Kusum!

1780
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:57,530
Please leave.

1781
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,460
No chance in hell, Aman Tripathi.

1782
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:08,430
This isn't a game, bro.
Stop playing with my heart.

1783
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,360
What do you think, you're in a film,

1784
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,740
and the frame will freeze
at the end of your nuptials?

1785
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,220
The end. Happy ending.

1786
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:14,460
No way!

1787
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,030
You will get roasted
right from your wedding night.

1788
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,790
Will you be able to perform,
life long?

1789
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,870
Can you play the role
of a dutiful husband?

1790
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:23,950
When she goes gallivanting
with her boyfriend...

1791
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,810
will you be able
stay calm when she asks,

1792
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:27,050
'how am I looking baby?'

1793
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,180
Can you handle that?

1794
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,020
Kartik, I tried my best
to make them understand.

1795
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,200
You know I did.

1796
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,580
You think you did!

1797
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:38,290
Don't get fooled.

1798
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,350
They are your parents.

1799
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,050
I'm sure they knew all
along that you're different.

1800
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:45,820
And your father,
the villain of the piece...

1801
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:48,520
he who had celebrated your birth.

1802
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,810
He knows that his son likes men.

1803
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,360
They are your parents.

1804
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,990
They know everything about you...
Right from the beginning.

1805
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,690
Your likes,
dislikes, every f*&king thing.

1806
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,490
They are unable to accept this,
thinking of

1807
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,350
what people would say.
What would society say?

1808
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,580
And Shankar Tripathi has
seen this fear in you as well.

1809
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,790
You are scared of coming out.

1810
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,980
What do I do? Tell me.

1811
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,120
What should I do?

1812
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,630
Don't get carried away.

1813
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:20,660
He has been fighting this ever
since he saw us, inside the train.

1814
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,800
He is ready for a fight.

1815
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,820
Unfortunately,
there is no one to take him on.

1816
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:31,810
I have been at the receiving end
of this kind of frustration. Twice.

1817
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,840
Are you leaving?

1818
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,360
Not so soon.

1819
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:51,850
I'll see you getting married,
before I leave.

1820
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,130
Remember one thing,

1821
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:59,690
it's not often that you
get a chance to be a hero.

1822
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:04,340
Now you decide, who you want to be -

1823
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,450
the hero or a bystander,
in this story.

1824
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,380
Put some more lights up here.

1825
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:24,860
Sunaina?

1826
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:27,860
You're here.
Aren't you ready?

1827
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:30,820
- Listen.
- Yes?

1828
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:35,180
There was something else
written on that piece of paper.

1829
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,900
What was written on it?

1830
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,060
One minute, I'll show it to you.

1831
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,190
On the back it is written -

1832
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,330
The legality of Article 377...

1833
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:46,830
Let me close the door.

1834
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:58,090
The Supreme Court will decide
the legality of Article 377, tomorrow.

1835
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,530
It means, tomorrow it will be decided

1836
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,490
whether what Aman and Kartik
are doing, is legal or not.

1837
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,100
What do you want me to do?

1838
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:07,890
Pack a bag and leave from here.

1839
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:10,370
I'll ask Chaman to
drop you to the station.

1840
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,200
This matter being debated in
the Supreme Court affects us as well.

1841
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:20,220
Tomorrow, if the Court decides
that homosexuality is not a crime...

1842
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:21,640
Then what?

1843
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:22,610
Then what?

1844
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:27,260
You'll be thrown in jail
for torturing Aman and Kartik.

1845
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,920
You can go ahead and ask them
these questions when you're in jail.

1846
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,190
Even if our son doesn't, that boy...

1847
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,600
Kartik will definitely
file a case against you.

1848
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,900
Why did you beat him so mercilessly?

1849
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,000
I won't be the only one going to jail.

1850
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,570
All of you are involved in this.

1851
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,740
The entire family will go to jail.

1852
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:39,830
I won't.

1853
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,190
I am the mother.

1854
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,800
I'll say I was busy in the kitchen
when you guys were doing all this.

1855
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,030
And you'll send me to jail?

1856
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:53,410
So now, the Supreme Court will
decide for us, what's right and wrong?

1857
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:55,070
Yes, that's what they do.

1858
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:56,590
Do you have any higher
authority than them?

1859
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,710
And we don't understand anything?

1860
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,350
No, you don't.

1861
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,980
I'll say that I've
learnt the truth just now.

1862
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,850
I had to give up my studies
after I got married to this man.

1863
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,050
I am an uneducated woman after all.

1864
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:10,310
So much to do at home.

1865
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:13,110
Sunaina, don't pretend
to be a helpless woman.

1866
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,680
I wasn't alone in all this.

1867
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,010
Who beat up that boy?

1868
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,290
Why didn't you stop me?

1869
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:19,000
Who got the stick?

1870
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,240
You...

1871
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,930
It has been 25 years, Mr. Tripathi.

1872
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:26,470
It's high time you got your aim right.

1873
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:30,100
Sunaina,
why get into this argument today?

1874
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:33,770
Throwing me to the wolves so
that you can become the ideal mother?

1875
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,250
Of course, I am the ideal mother.

1876
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,860
Mothers are run by emotions.

1877
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:38,880
And fathers run on batteries, right?

1878
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,080
Can't say about the others...

1879
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,970
All I can say is,
for the past 25 years,

1880
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,840
you've been living
with me half-heartedly.

1881
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,470
You'd given away half of your
heart to Rani, before we got married.

1882
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:47,390
Brother!

1883
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:49,150
Did you have sex with her?

1884
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:53,740
First you tell me.
What all have you done with Kumar?

1885
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,030
What hurt you more?

1886
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,340
Giving up your studies
or giving up Kumar?

1887
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,420
You must really miss her!

1888
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,260
You're always sitting in the bathroom!

1889
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,320
Brother!

1890
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,130
Aman is ready.

1891
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:05,290
We are coming!

1892
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,330
Your brother is upset, again!

1893
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,460
You could also get upset sometimes.

1894
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,480
Disgusting.

1895
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,010
Same to you, Sunaina.

1896
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:15,990
Same to you.

1897
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,900
I have seen your Facebook account.

1898
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,060
There are multiple searches for Kumar.

1899
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,780
Why?

1900
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,600
Why don't you answer?

1901
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,010
Cat got your tongue?

1902
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,300
Tell me!

1903
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,670
I only searched for him online,

1904
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:34,150
but you... have an entire
album full of Rani's photos.

1905
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,570
We are ruining his life.

1906
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:27,990
We are forcing him to live a life
that he doesn't want to. Just like us.

1907
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,280
We are bad people.

1908
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,740
No, we are not.

1909
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:33,320
Would good people
do something like this?

1910
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,250
We aren't good either.

1911
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,760
We are just people.

1912
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,670
I am not feeling bad about it.
What can I do?

1913
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:42,950
Sunaina, let him get married.

1914
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:44,440
Everything will be fine.

1915
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:45,820
I swear.

1916
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,800
He has made a promise.

1917
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,110
Where's that sheet of paper?

1918
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:53,110
We'll show that paper to
the police and nothing will happen.

1919
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,200
He is our son.

1920
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,530
Okay?

1921
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:59,730
Our guests have arrived.

1922
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,600
Let's not mess things up now.

1923
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,330
Okay?

1924
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,880
Why are you wasting time?

1925
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,540
Get lost.

1926
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,720
This is your science.

1927
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,410
And these worms your nature

1928
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:50,620
Let me see if there is any science
that can change your son's nature.

1929
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,350
Congratulations on the wedding.

1930
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:51,380
In the previous episode
you saw how Kusum

1931
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:56,250
agreed to marry Shankar Tripathi's
gay son and fooled the entire family.

1932
01:31:56,830 --> 01:32:01,800
The desperate and unsuspecting mother
handed over all her jewellery to Kusum.

1933
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,540
And Kusum ran away with all
the jewellery, before the wedding.

1934
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:11,150
To guard their son's secret no one
will lodge a complaint against Kusum.

1935
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:13,170
Kusum is a free bird now.

1936
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:16,340
She has fought for her
love and earned her freedom.

1937
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:18,980
Will the Tripathi family
be able to overcome this?

1938
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:21,890
Will Aman be able
to fight his own battle?

1939
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,850
Who cares!

1940
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:26,000
Rakesh's lover, Kusum.

1941
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,620
What!

1942
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,120
She ran away.

1943
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:33,880
What the hell!

1944
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,390
Should I get the bride, Panditji?

1945
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,770
She has all my jewellery.

1946
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:42,970
Should I get her?

1947
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:45,520
Goggle, go and get her.

1948
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,390
Why?

1949
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,400
Go.

1950
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,190
Children these days...

1951
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:00,080
Are you ready? Bhabhi!

1952
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,960
Kusum?

1953
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:04,050
The Panditji wants you there.

1954
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:05,750
I don't really care
about this wedding.

1955
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:08,390
My brother's life
is getting ruined anyway.

1956
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,490
Hello!

1957
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:16,360
Do you want to get married or not?

1958
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,360
Why are you wearing this shawl?

1959
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:33,690
I'm shivering.

1960
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,640
It's too cold, ya.

1961
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,880
Goggle! Hurry up.

1962
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,410
I'll be right there.

1963
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:41,980
Be patient. It takes time
for a bride to get ready and come.

1964
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,090
Haven't yet found someone for me,
in 27 years...

1965
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:45,990
you're in a big hurry
to get your son married!

1966
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,170
Do you want me to carry you down?

1967
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:52,460
Let's go!

1968
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,970
Woman, what are you waiting for?
'Here comes the bride'?

1969
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:01,250
There's a curfew in the city.
Hurry up.

1970
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,670
How have you worn the saree?

1971
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:09,340
It's me Kartik, Goggle.

1972
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:11,010
I hope they don't recognise me.

1973
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:12,200
Where's Kusum?

1974
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:15,430
She has run away.

1975
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:16,890
Run away?

1976
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,200
Just in case something goes wrong,
please save my ass.

1977
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,820
If something goes wrong.

1978
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:22,910
If?

1979
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:25,140
If you manage to stay alive
till the ceremony gets over,

1980
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:26,780
I'll give you 100 bucks.

1981
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:28,740
Remember, I'd saved your life earlier.

1982
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,220
Yes, but that was
from the Indian railways.

1983
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,890
We're dealing with
the Tripathi clan here.

1984
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:34,720
No one can save you now.

1985
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,330
Please call the bride.

1986
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,030
Where were you?

1987
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:43,690
What do you mean?
I was getting her ready.

1988
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:45,370
It takes time.

1989
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:47,150
Where are you going?

1990
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:53,020
Why are you sulking?

1991
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,260
At least someone is happy here.

1992
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,980
Our daughter will also be happy,
one day.

1993
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,850
Has she always been this tall?

1994
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,060
She's wearing heels. Be quiet.

1995
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:02,800
Are you okay, my dear?

1996
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:04,550
Do you want something?

1997
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,310
Are you feeling cold?

1998
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,040
Her hands are so hairy.

1999
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,780
Didn't she get her arms waxed?

2000
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:15,530
She's a modern girl.

2001
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:18,540
She wants Aman to accept
her the way she is.

2002
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,230
But she did go to the salon,
didn't she?

2003
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,020
She took money from me.

2004
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,950
Relax, Aunty.

2005
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:26,220
Aren't you going a little slow,Panditji?

2006
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,190
Yes.

2007
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:28,890
Get ready for the vows.

2008
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,560
Come on, stand up.

2009
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,620
One minute.

2010
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:39,870
Mummy!

2011
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,670
Are you drunk?

2012
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,930
One minute.

2013
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,850
Why are you following her?

2014
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:56,080
She's not going anywhere.

2015
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:58,950
Where are you going?

2016
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:00,660
Just a minute.

2017
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,480
Pause.

2018
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:04,110
Pause.

2019
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:06,980
I want to lift the veil.

2020
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:07,890
Whose?

2021
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:09,350
The bride's.

2022
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,030
What are you saying?

2023
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:13,310
The bride does not show her
face before the wedding is over.

2024
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,720
And certainly not
to her father-in-law.

2025
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,070
But I want to.

2026
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,340
Are you mad?

2027
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,740
Why are you insisting?

2028
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,230
Why do you want to see her face?

2029
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,480
Because I want to.

2030
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,250
That's it.

2031
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:25,730
If you must, here, lift my veil.

2032
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:26,820
Why do you want to lift her veil?

2033
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:27,570
Lift mine!

2034
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,510
No, I want to lift hers.

2035
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,980
This is too much, Mr. Tripathi.

2036
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:34,870
- Can't you see how scared she is?
- I'm scared.

2037
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,720
What a dirty mind!

2038
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,790
Absolutely correct.

2039
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,490
I have a dirty mind.

2040
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,300
But, at least I have a mind.

2041
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:45,500
Which none of you seem to have.

2042
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:46,750
One minute.

2043
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,110
Calm down.

2044
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:49,310
Be patient.

2045
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,100
Give me a moment.

2046
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,330
What are you doing?

2047
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:56,550
Chaman, stop her.

2048
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:57,310
No I won't, Brother.

2049
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:58,350
Do it yourself.

2050
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:00,230
You can have half the property.
Just stop her.

2051
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:01,160
Go!

2052
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:03,040
Why is Papa doing this, Mummy?

2053
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,110
Forget him,
why does Kusum keep running away?

2054
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:06,360
It's not Kusum. It's Kartik.

2055
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,540
Catch him.

2056
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:14,130
What's wrong with you, Kartik?

2057
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,770
Why are you after him?

2058
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:17,380
Kusum is the one who ran away.
Look at this.

2059
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:19,890
She has run away with
all your jewellery, Aunty.

2060
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,320
All my jewellery?

2061
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,300
Fake jewellery is the best,
I told you so.

2062
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,910
Our daughter-in-law has run away and
you're more worried about your jewellery?

2063
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,250
It's my wedding jewellery.

2064
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,630
The jewellery maybe gone,
but you are safe.

2065
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:32,850
Stay away!

2066
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,110
Catch him.

2067
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:34,950
What the hell are you doing, Kartik?

2068
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:36,110
Catch him.

2069
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,690
Chaman, catch him!

2070
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,390
Why are you going there?

2071
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,010
Where are my shoes, Keshav?

2072
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:44,390
Kartik! Uncle, what...!

2073
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:45,450
I got him, Brother!

2074
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,010
Caught behind!

2075
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:48,750
Take if off.

2076
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,010
Take off the sari.

2077
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:51,890
Why?

2078
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:54,690
Won't you take it off for me?

2079
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,570
- Stop, Papa. This is enough.
- Why are you doing this?

2080
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:00,680
Why are you doing this?

2081
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,530
The people you are trying to impress,
they're laughing at you.

2082
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:06,200
They aren't laughing at Kartik or me.

2083
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:10,220
They are laughing at your antics.

2084
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,230
I don't feel sorry for you.

2085
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:14,770
Do you know why?

2086
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,180
Because I had never
expected you to understand.

2087
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:22,870
I have been quiet all my life.

2088
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,230
Because I couldn't see you like this.

2089
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,820
What are you saying, Aman?

2090
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,500
He's your father.

2091
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,200
Not everyone is lucky to have one.

2092
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:33,530
Ask me about it.

2093
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,690
I had told you, they won't understand.

2094
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,520
Of course, they won't.

2095
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,260
They have no idea.

2096
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:45,010
They are familiar with Romeo
Juliet and other love stories.

2097
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:49,260
But our kind of love... is
something unfamiliar to them.

2098
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,200
They won't understand.

2099
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:54,890
And what they don't understand,
they try to stifle.

2100
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,820
Don't worry.

2101
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:01,020
It's our battle and
we will fight it ourselves.

2102
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:03,920
Let's go, Aman.

2103
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,670
Just a minute.

2104
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,060
Tell me something.

2105
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,430
Does the fact that I love this man,
change our relationship in any way?

2106
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,250
Why the hell do sons have
to save the day every time?

2107
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:19,230
Fathers can save the day as well!

2108
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,470
And Mummy,
you may have lost your jewellery now.

2109
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:24,220
But you'd lost your
son much before this.

2110
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,580
Now that you've lost it all,
why stop at this.

2111
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:28,540
Let's go all the way.

2112
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,890
Let's go, Kartik.

2113
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:32,660
Panditji, let's start the nuptials.

2114
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,580
But you haven't proposed to me yet.

2115
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,100
Mummy, get ready for this.

2116
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:41,620
This kind of a wedding will
be more common in the coming years.

2117
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:43,350
Panditji, let's start.

2118
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,470
It's time to set an example.

2119
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:48,680
No.

2120
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,910
I cannot be a part of this.

2121
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,630
Fine, Panditji,
why don't you sing a song instead?

2122
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:54,630
It's just a formality.

2123
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,150
The entire family is already here.

2124
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:59,120
They will get busy with
their lives from tomorrow.

2125
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,320
And who knows what the Court
is going to decide tomorrow.

2126
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:04,600
See, Panditji...

2127
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,960
according to the scriptures, marriage
is a union of two souls, right?

2128
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,880
Do souls have a gender?

2129
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:11,540
No.

2130
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:13,700
Then start singing, bro!

2131
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:21,100
This friendship is something
we will never give up.

2132
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:25,730
I am willing to give up my life,

2133
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,740
but I am never willing to give you up.

2134
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:33,170
This friendship...

2135
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:34,880
No one will move.

2136
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:38,580
We have come to arrest these two.

2137
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,760
According to Article 377,
being gay is a crime.

2138
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:43,810
A crime that is being
committed openly here.

2139
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:45,490
What are you saying?

2140
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,800
How can you just arrest these boys?

2141
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:51,920
We will have to arrest them.

2142
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,550
Please don't interfere.

2143
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:54,750
Arrest these lover boys.

2144
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:56,370
One minute.

2145
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,230
Do something.

2146
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,900
Stop them!

2147
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:02,450
Let's go.

2148
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,600
Alright, Inspector,
you can take them away.

2149
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,980
He's the father.

2150
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:14,910
There isn't much he is capable of,
except sulk.

2151
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:21,290
And he's the son, he expects
us to change our beliefs overnight.

2152
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:23,870
Take them away.

2153
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:25,140
Let's end this matter.

2154
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,190
The family was falling apart anyway.

2155
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:33,080
Shankar Tripathi isn't capable
of putting up a fight anymore.

2156
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:38,770
Come on, let's go.

2157
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:39,290
Wait.

2158
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:41,350
Just a minute, Inspector.

2159
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,260
Just a minute, Inspector.

2160
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,090
This is our house.

2161
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:50,480
Our family.

2162
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,700
And this is our
personal family matter.

2163
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,960
We will deal with it.

2164
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,080
According to law,
being gay is a crime, Uncle.

2165
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,410
Excuse me.

2166
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:03,880
Move aside, Champa.

2167
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,650
- Go from that side!
- Okay.

2168
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,470
Don't try to teach me the law,
Inspector.

2169
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:11,250
My name is Chaman Tripathi.

2170
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,290
I am their family lawyer.

2171
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,350
And a part of their family as well.

2172
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,880
So... according to law,
being gay is a crime.

2173
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,550
- Okay?
- Okay.

2174
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:29,450
But how can you assume
that these two are gay?

2175
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:30,730
I see.

2176
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,690
Get her.

2177
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,030
This girl has told us everything.

2178
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:38,480
We caught her at the bus
stop with all the jewellery.

2179
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,070
The jewellery that she has stolen.

2180
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:45,400
Who is she to decide
whether they are gay or not?

2181
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:49,670
Tell me, have you caught
them doing anything

2182
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,880
that made you believe
that they are gay?

2183
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,710
Go on. Tell me.

2184
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:54,820
I am their lawyer.

2185
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:56,870
No, you haven't.

2186
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:59,810
Then how will you prove this in court?

2187
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:00,980
How?

2188
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,760
Let me present my next argument.

2189
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:07,160
Champa!

2190
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,700
Give me your blessings, Brother.

2191
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,320
If two consenting adult men hold hands

2192
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,040
or do anything in the confines
of their bedroom... Bhabhi...

2193
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:22,800
Then you, me or anyone for that
matter, should not have any objection.

2194
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,410
Well done.

2195
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,370
Well done, Mr. Lawyer.

2196
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:31,510
Right?

2197
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:41,200
Inspector, whatever they are doing,
it's their choice.

2198
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,360
When we don't have the right to question
their choice, who are you to interfere?

2199
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:50,090
- Like I said, the law...
- Which can change tomorrow.

2200
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,970
You may come tomorrow, after the
Supreme Court has passed its judgement.

2201
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:56,030
Until then... Keshav!
They are free to go.

2202
01:43:56,110 --> 01:43:56,630
- Okay, Uncle.
- Please.

2203
01:43:56,770 --> 01:43:57,380
Let's go.

2204
01:43:57,570 --> 01:44:00,390
If you don't mind, Mr. Tripathi,
we will stay right here.

2205
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:03,670
Until the ruling is passed,
we have to follow the law.

2206
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,420
The accused may run away.

2207
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,060
What's wrong is wrong.

2208
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:09,920
Yes, what's wrong is wrong.

2209
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,380
Of course. Let me invite you to stay.

2210
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:17,000
We have a lot of food
and not too many guests.

2211
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,920
We have some tasty
black cauliflower snacks.

2212
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:20,970
They are very nutritious.
You must try some.

2213
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:23,110
We are on duty. It's not allowed.

2214
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:25,590
It's black cauliflower I'm offering,
not black money.

2215
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:26,470
Come with me.

2216
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:44,560
They say, love shouldn't cross limits

2217
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:48,080
They, who have never been in love

2218
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:51,620
This heart is a simpleton

2219
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,840
Unable to fathom the ways of the world

2220
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,650
They may think they know us

2221
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:03,330
But they don't

2222
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:10,040
We may get finished
But our passion will remain

2223
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:13,680
The embers of our love will
Burn on

2224
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:17,330
Our misty eyes Will forever

2225
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:20,940
Hope for happiness

2226
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:24,480
We may get finished
But our passion will remain

2227
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:28,310
The embers of our love will
Burn on

2228
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:31,630
Our misty eyes
Will forever

2229
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:36,200
Hope for happiness

2230
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:45,380
Love will not be stifled

2231
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:49,210
And driven away by fear

2232
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:53,080
The embers of hope will remain

2233
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:56,880
And will grow from the pain

2234
01:45:57,390 --> 01:46:00,870
We will grow stronger

2235
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:04,400
With every blow

2236
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:09,130
'Breaking News!'

2237
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:12,810
'The Supreme Court has passed
a landmark judgement on homosexuality.'

2238
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:15,030
'In their judgement,
Supreme Court has stated that'

2239
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:21,020
'same-gender, private relationships
between two consenting adults,'

2240
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:24,430
'will not be considered a crime.'

2241
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:28,600
We may get finished
But our passion will remain

2242
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:32,210
The embers of our love will
Burn on

2243
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:35,840
Our misty eyes
Will forever

2244
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:40,070
Hope for happiness

2245
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,820
No matter how harsh the axe

2246
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:55,460
The root will find a way to live

2247
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:59,030
One love, one war
Both are at fault

2248
01:46:59,150 --> 01:47:02,600
Will have to find a way together

2249
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:06,210
It's hard enough to control my heart

2250
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:10,080
I don't care about what people say

2251
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:23,030
Let me drop you off at the station.

2252
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,870
Come Kartik, Papa will drop us.

2253
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:30,940
I won't sit on the bike.

2254
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:32,160
But why?

2255
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:34,890
I want to drive it.

2256
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:36,160
- I won't let you.
- I want to drive it.

2257
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:36,920
- I won't let you.
- I want to drive it.

2258
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,670
- I won't let you.
- I want to drive it.

2259
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:38,710
Drive it.

2260
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,080
Let him ride.

2261
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:44,090
I'll drive.

2262
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:48,780
We may get finished
But our passion will remain

2263
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:52,460
The embers of our love will
Burn on

2264
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:56,040
Our misty eyes
Will forever

2265
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:59,820
Hope for happiness

2266
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,540
Okay, Papa.

2267
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:14,820
Don't call me Papa.

2268
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,210
Papaji?

2269
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,090
Papa is fine.

2270
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:37,950
I don't know...

2271
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:41,210
if I will ever understand this thing.

2272
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:50,220
But don't let me stop you
from living your life to the fullest.

2273
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:56,030
Go ahead and live your life, son.

2274
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:04,520
Go.

2275
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,190
Hurry up or you'll miss the train.

2276
01:49:57,690 --> 01:50:00,830
We are running for love.

2277
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,920
Just like Laila would have,
for Juliet.

2278
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:05,950
Majnu would have, for Romeo.

2279
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,560
Simran would have, for Anjali.

2280
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:10,000
Veeru would have perhaps, for Jai.

2281
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:11,880
Weddings happen at a fixed time,

2282
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:15,620
but there is no fixed
time to fall in love.

2283
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:19,210
Love has no fixed colour or gender.

2284
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:21,970
We have to remove the restrictions
we impose on our hearts...

2285
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:23,540
to be with the one we love.

2286
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:25,410
Until then

2287
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:27,110
we'll keep running

2288
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:29,530
for our love.
